ID=5141
That’s the bed that the little one spent more than half the day in.\nThe bed on which he’d stuck little stickers of his favourite characters. It looks a little the worse for wear, but...\n It seems to suit a child, and I like that.

ID=5211
That’s the straw hat that my little brother always wore to the beach.\nI always put the straw hat on him so that his face was safe from UV rays.

ID=5221

ID=5231

ID=5241

ID=5251

ID=5321
The air was always dry in the office. \nWhether it was because of the dry weather, or the tense atmosphere there, we constantly needed the humidifier on.\nAs he was always the first one in, he got used to turning the humidifier on.\nHe probably used it to combat the dry air.

ID=5331

ID=5341

Pheww, that’s really hard work.

ID=5361

ID=5122
That is a puppet that will dance about in the empty room if it’s supplied with air.\nThere is a device at the bottom that controls the air supply and lets the puppet dance.\nThe doctor in the practise opposite says that it moves like that because it doesn’t have any ‘limbs’.\nHe talks about it like it’s a ‘person’! He’s a very strange guy.

ID=5132
I’m second to none when it comes to shovelling.\nIt makes me seem manlier!\nI was probably born to do manual labour. I’ve never found it difficult or menial, unlike other people. \nI like that I can just concentrate on work and close out my thoughts.

ID=5142
Whenever he started to whine about wanting some fresh air, his parents would awkwardly bring out the wheelchair.\nIt was a small affair, it looked very cheap.\nBut it was the little one’s only way to explore the world outside his bed.

ID=5212

ID=5222
This lamp is the only source of light in the dark underground.\nWhen I first ventured down there, my eyes weren’t used to the dark so I needed this lamp even more than was usual.

ID=5232
The armchair was always pointing towards the window.\nOn rainy days she’d sit in the armchair and look out of it, lost in thought.\nIf I went closer to her, thinking she might like someone to talk to, she would glance at me and smile.\nThen turn silently back to the window.

ID=5242
Studying on a cold floor, in front of a wobbly table with legs that might break at any second...\nI’ll never forget that. Not that I want to remember!\nBut you develop the sense that everything would be okay on a desk like that.

ID=5252
Pilots always wear an oxygen mask while they’re flying.\nThe mask gives them the oxygen they need while the plane is high.\nI always begged him to check his mask first when entering the plane.

ID=5312
That’s the yellow sign that protects us from the flood of cars racing by.\nIt marks off our part of the much frequented motorway.\nOther people can’t just come into here, but then we can’t just leave either, which can sometimes make the sign seem a bit like a prison fence.

ID=5322
He disappeared with a big box.\nAll of his loyalty and excitement for the job seemed to disappear with him and his box.\nHad he not shown enough passion? Or maybe he wasn’t good enough?\nHe didn’t know. All that was certain was that the company didn’t need him anymore.

ID=5332
The first thing that she checked once she got to work was the fire extinguisher. \nThen she taught me how to use the fire extinguisher, step by step.\nShe had given the same lesson to the other colleagues.\nShe was a natural teacher.

ID=5342
Even though dad was tall, he always climbed the ladder.\nOn the ladder he was so tall that his hands touched the sky.\nThen I’d follow him and climb up on the other side of the ladder.\nDad laughed, but mum always shouted that it was too dangerous.

ID=5352
The moment my secure lifeline started to shake, my heart throbbed too.\nIn films superheroes just fly through the air. But how they do something so scary, I will never know...\nWell I guess it’s because films aren’t like real life, right?

ID=5362
Before we were at this company, this place was maybe used for paper production or as a printers. The slicer was the only piece of equipment remaining that was still usable. What sort of company was it...?\nMaybe it was even an organisation with a bigger secret than ours.

ID=5113
That’s the toolbox that she bought with what little she’d saved for my first day at work.\nIt was expensive, the tools are from a well-known brand...\nThere’s a note in the box.\nIn tiny handwriting it reads: ‘All my best’, but I can’t really read it because of the tears in my eyes.

ID=5123
Obviously the most important thing for a young entrepreneur is to look for new business ideas.\nThis menu is the result of my research.\nIt is the masterpiece that I have spent many nights achieving, in which I diligently expanded and then trimmed the menu, and spent a long time thinking of nothing else.\nI even thought about hiring a professional. But in the end I decided it wasn’t worth the money and did it myself.

ID=5133
But even though I love building, I really can’t stand having to carry cement bags around.\nThat is unbelievably difficult work.\nI already feel tired enough for a good meal after carrying just one bag.

ID=5143
That is the big teddy bear that the little one never let out of his grasp for a second.\nHe often said it was a dream of his to one day go to a petting zoo and touch a real bear.\nI don’t need to tell you that a bear can exert 1 tonne of force with its paw, do I?

ID=5213
My little brother couldn’t swim so he always took his swim ring into the water with him.\nHe always had to have a ring which had his favourite characters on it.\nIt was too childish a thing for an adult, but it suited my brother.\nWhen you’re that age, those sorts of things just work.

ID=5223
When you used a plunger on the toilet, then the blockage started to clear itself. The stink coming from the pipe after the huge amount of time it had been blocked was truly awful. \nOnce you’ve experienced that stink, you don’t really want to work here anymore. But I thought about the people who had been dealing with this sort of thing for decades and decided not to complain.

ID=5233

ID=5243
There was no such thing as rubbish for me. Everything had to be reused.\nPaper, tissues, plastic bags... There was nothing I would throw away.\nBut it’s different here. Once something has fulfilled its purpose, it’s in the bin.\nNo ifs or buts.

ID=5253
One day he brought both our daughters some life jackets.\nThis was probably because our youngest had whined that she wanted to look like daddy.\nAt first I thought they weren’t real ones and didn’t think anything of it. But then I realised that they were real life jackets. I went pale with shock.

ID=5313
It made sure the cars drove on the other lane.\nBut it was the kind of bright colour that made you ask yourself whether such a glaring colour was even legal.\nDespite how bright the sign is, there was always the possibility that a learner or someone tired might drive through the sign and over us, so we never felt totally safe.

ID=5323
He worked with vigour and conviction, which meant he always had enough to do.\nI would often gaze, bored, along his bookcase.\nEvery time I did he somehow noticed and asked me, without turning around, ‘whether I wanted to go for a smoke with him’.\nIt always seemed like he had eyes in the back of his head.

When I asked her to sit down so that she didn’t disturb me as I worked, she got the broom from the corner and began to sweep up.\nWhen I asked her why she couldn’t just settle down, she replied that would be too unproductive. She criticised me for even suggesting it.

Dad liked me coming with him to work, but I always had to wear a helmet.\nHe told me that where he works is dangerous and little kids like me can get hurt if they run around without looking.\nSafety comes first! Or something like that...\nWell, I know better than anyone that safety is the most important thing.

ID=5354
One wrong step and it would have been over for me!\nThe first time I had the cleaning bucket and got distracted by my thoughts, he ignored my contemplating and kicked me in the backside as he passed by! I was really worried... \nEveryone laughed at me, as though they thought it was cute, and I felt like no one took me seriously.

ID=5364
Who knows who last used this cushion. It’s full of dust from somewhere.\nSomeone obviously worked here.\nBut what sort of work they did remains a mystery...

ID=5411
My light, my love, my destiny - my Lucy! The figurine from the limited special edition.\nDo you know how hard I had to try to be able to buy this?  \nThat is an unbelievable story, that no one can hear without getting teary eyed! \nOf course it’s not really worth telling.

ID=5412
That is a cardboard cutout that came with the limited special edition of the ‘Neon Princess Lucy - The Great Phosphorous Crystal Adventure’ DVD.\nGreat, isn’t it? You’re so jealous of me, am I right? No wonder.\nAfter all, it’s a limited version and there are only 500 of them!\nAhahahah! Lucy’s bright, beautiful face is... RIGHT HERE! Do you see it? Oh Lucy...

ID=5413
This is something that always puts me right to sleep.\nMy dreams are always sweet with this.\nWhen I hold this in my arms as I sleep, I can see Lucy in my dreams!

ID=5414
If Lucy were real she would have a similar build to this and be about this tall.\nOne day I have to meet her and speak to her. \nShe will probably be much more beautiful and hot than I can imagine!

ID=5421
That is a mop. It consists of a long wooden handle with some long strips of fabric hanging from it.\nTo use it correctly, you have to use the right amount of force. \nOne time I moved it forward with too much force, pushing myself instead of the mop and I fell over.\nI was worried I might have hurt my knee, and I was relieved that all the master did was laugh loudly.

ID=5422
That is a feather duster. You use it to dust things.\nIts four glowing colours are very memorable. They seem like the colours of the ‘feelings’ that only I can see and that’s why it made me feel good to see them.\nWhen I got distracted by the colours for a moment, the master started to complain that I wasn’t working.\nI had to quickly get back to work.

ID=5423
That is a vacuum cleaner. \nWhen I asked if it was a weapon because it was so loud when he turned it on, the master chided me. \nI was impressed by how well it sucked up dirt as soon as you held the hose over a dirty place.\nBut it did worry me that it wasn’t very picky about what it sucked up.

ID=5424
That is a water atomiser. If you push the grip, the water sprays out of the hole at the front.\nThe master told me I should use it when I need a lot of water to clean something.\nUsing two cleaning things at once...\nIt was a strange device that made cleaning more complicated.

ID=5431
If you hit this pickaxe against hard ground you can feel it in your hand.\nThat prickly feeling that goes through the hand is close to the feeling of an electric shock.\nThat’s why you have to be careful. What’s got him moving so fast? As if it wasn’t hectic enough at this job!\nIt worries me.

ID=5432
The majority of accidents happen with dynamite.\nWhat makes it more dangerous is that it’s not only you that dies if you handle it incorrectly, but the people around you as well.\nWhen he was told to use it, my heart and my courage sank.\nI wished he wouldn’t do these things...

ID=5433
Every day he had to pass through dark tunnels.\nI didn’t want him to get confused in the dark, so I put together a helmet with a lamp on it and gave it to him.\nOf course my boss told me off for doing this, saying I wasn’t responsible for that equipment.\nBut it always made me feel calmer than if I let others do it. It was just my way.

ID=5434
The wheelbarrow he’s pulling weighs at least 500kg. \nIt sounds crazy, but he said he was carrying that weight so the people after him wouldn’t have to.\nHe’s such a good person... But he should pay more attention to his health... It’s really naive of him.

ID=5441
I was surprised to find that he’d developed his plastic model into a real robot.\nIs this what you’d call the success story of the obsessed?\nHe always said he wasn’t obsessed, he was a specialist - as if that wasn’t essentially the same thing!\nHe adored his robot... Unbelievable, right?

ID=5442
When I asked him why he liked these tin cans so much he pointed the welder towards me.\nMan, what a dangerous thing to point at someone!\nNormally he was a weakling, but in situations like that his more aggressive nature came to the fore.\nWhy do I like someone like this?

ID=5443
He looked like a mechanic while working with the welder.\nBut when I told him I found how he looked while he worked attractive, he just gave me an insulted look.\nWhat did I do wrong now?

ID=5444
These gloves protect his hands. Their special qualities helped when working with hot materials and dangerous tools such as the welder.\nWhen he put on his gloves, all you could see of his little body were his hands. When I told him ‘you look like a robot’ he was really happy.\nI didn’t mean it as a compliment... How am I supposed to know what he does and doesn’t like?

ID=5451
The mini fridge provides a parched throat with cool drinks.\nIf it weren’t there then I’d probably have died of thirst what with all the pressure at work.\nIt was the easiest and most useful thing that the company made available.

ID=5452
Made available.\nBecause we weren’t allowed to bring things in with us, we were obliged to use the equipment provided for us.\nEven though you would have had better stuff yourself.

ID=5453
This is the laptop that the company provided for me.\nIt helped manage the people who had a connection with the investigation.\nEverything typed into it was saved directly onto the company’s main computer.\nSo you could never shake the feeling that you were constantly being observed.

ID=5454
If there wasn’t much light in the lab and I turned on my desk lamp then an atmosphere arose that let me think properly.\nEvery night in the lab I would sink into my thoughts while my desk lamp glowed.\nI would pray for forgiveness for the sins I had committed during the course of the day.

ID=5461
They told me to keep the radio with me while I went for a walk.\nI needed it in case I needed to call for help.\nWhat dangers lie in wait in this place...\nThose kinds of thoughts never left me alone.

ID=5462
The truncheon is a weapon that gives its bearer a lot of power.\nBut what happens if you’re attacked SoulForcer? You’re probably already dead before you can lift the truncheon.\nThese ‘words’ made it clear to me: our life was worth nothing to them.

ID=5463
As I held the shield in my hand I felt a bit safer.\nWhich was a good thing because it was the only thing protecting me from the unforeseeable dangers of this hidden place.\nThe shield wouldn’t have been much help in an emergency, but maybe I’d have more time to run away because of it.

ID=5464
The supervisor that gave me this pistol told me to shoot anyone that looked suspicious.\nWhat is going on here?\nWhat’s their ‘secret’? I couldn’t figure it out. \nBut I knew that I wouldn’t escape the ‘word’ until I uncovered the secret. This knowledge preyed on me more than anything else.

ID=5471
The surface had peaks that looked like my pinking shears.\nWhen I asked father if I could touch the teeth of the saw he got scared and put it away.\nI’m sure I could have touched it without hurting myself. Father is such a scaredy-cat!

ID=5472
This is a long wooden staff that was made by sawing rectangular pieces of wood.\nIt’s really fun to lie it down lengthways and stand on it facing sideways, or to try and balance on it like a tightrope with my arms out.\nBut... Father was angry with me the last time he caught me doing it. That’s why I had to do it secretly.

ID=5473
When I asked father to put me on the rubber dinghy, he said ‘My child, you are not allowed to sail on ships.\nThat’s the condition on which you’re allowed to live here with me - I had to promise that I wouldn’t let you do that.’\nI didn’t push it, because father looked like he was about to cry.\nBut I never understood why I wasn’t allowed to sail the boat

ID=5474
That’s a model of the ship that my dad and the other men are working on right now.\nDoesn’t it look amazing? Great, right?\nOnce it’s finished I’ll be allowed to sail it at least once, right?\nThen I could finally go to the country on the other side of the sea, which I’ve only seen in books before now...
