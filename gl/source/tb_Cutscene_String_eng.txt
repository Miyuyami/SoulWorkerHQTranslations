Ah! Why did I want to become a doctor?

ID=100102
Because I wanted to help people, obviously! Hehe!

ID=100103
Mummy! Mummy! I did it! I even got top marks!

ID=100104
Warning! Warning! Return immediately to the bunker!

ID=100105
I repeat! Return immediately to the bunker!

ID=100106
Oh, mummy... please hold on! I’ll get you out of there.

ID=100107
We’ll make it, mummy... no! Please! NOOO!!!

How on earth do you win the big developers’ prize at the age of just 18?

ID=100202
That must’ve happened while I wasn’t paying attention. I can catch big fish in my sleep!

This amazing game, written by a regular high-school student, has occupied the top spot for 20 weeks!

One of the 100 most influential people on the planet, he refused every interview till this very day.

ID=100205
Oh man. Oh god, this world is such a bore.

ID=100206
The Great Void... grand cities destroyed... millions killed or missing...

ID=100207
Great Void... well that is something new. We should take a closer look at that.

ID=100208
How dreadfully... exciting! What are you exactly? Tell me!

ID=100209
Come on, out with it!

ID=100210
Alright, fine! Swallow me up then. I’ll find out myself!

ID=100301
Do you mean that thing which appeared here nearby?

ID=100302
I don’t know what that is exactly.

ID=100303
But I have something else I need to tell you! I went shopping today and...

ID=100304
Err, what’s going on?

ID=100305
How come it’s so loud in the middle of the night?

ID=100306
Ah, huh?! Aaaaah! No!

ID=100307
Hey! Who are you?!

ID=100308
Spit him out! Give me back my brother! Argh!

ID=100309
*sob* Aaaaah!

ID=100310
Ha... ha... Hahaha! Ahahahaha!

ID=100401
Three months have passed since the Great Void appeared.

ID=100402
The Great Void... grand cities destroyed... millions killed or missing...

ID=100403
Are we really safe here?

ID=100404
Yes, this is a safe zone. I promise!

ID=100405
All right... I trust you.

ID=100406
Well then! I’ve been a member of the rescue team for 2 months and have nothing but accolades to my name! Hahaha!

ID=100407
The Great Void! The Great Void! The Great Void has appeared... in our safe haven!

ID=100408
But you said we’d be safe here! Wh-wh-why...?

ID=100409
It’s all... because of me... It’s all my fault!

ID=100410
I have to save them. I have to!

ID=100411
Don’t go! You’ll die!

ID=100412
Waaaaah!

ID=100501
Why did you come to our village?

ID=100502
You brought a curse on them! They’re dead because of you!

ID=100503
N... no, it’s not... my fault.

ID=100504
Why would you say such a thing?

ID=100505
Is it really my fault? Maybe I should just go...

ID=100506
I am so sorry. Now I’m all alone again.

ID=100507
Old man, will we be alone there as well?

ID=100508
After all, there’s no one there to hate me.

ID=100509
I don’t want to be sad any more.

ID=100601
Iris! Don’t even think about going out to play!

ID=100602
But my friends are waiting for me...

ID=100603
I’m about to lose my cool!

ID=100604
Alright, fine, I understand.

ID=100605
Why can’t you be more like your sisters?!

ID=100606
But the scumbag messed with my friend Marie!

ID=100607
Why can’t you be more like your sisters?!

ID=100608
Why must you always go dragging the name of the Yuma clan through the mud?

ID=100609
But I don’t want to be like them!

ID=100610
I don’t need a family. I wish you’d all just disappear!

ID=100611
Warning! Warning! Return immediately to the bunker!

ID=100612
I repeat! Return immediately to the bunker!

ID=100613
Wh-what the...?

ID=100614
Noooo! Mummy! Daddy! Sisters!

ID=100615
Waaaaah!

ID=100616
I didn’t really mean it!

ID=100617
Why did you make them all disappear?!

ID=100618
You evil scoundrel!

ID=101001
You’ll wake up in another world.

ID=101002
There’s no place for normality in this world any more.

ID=101003
You have the power to change this world.

ID=101004
Denounce those who threaten this world!

ID=201001
Hurry! You’re being pursued by a Malevil.

ID=201101
You are me and I am you...

ID=201102
I swore an oath to protect you!

ID=201103
Remember that. You are me and I am you.

ID=201104
Promise me one thing. Promise that you will find me.

ID=201201
We are one, and yet we are two. We are two, though still we are one.

ID=201202
I swore an oath to protect you!

ID=201203
Remember that. We belong together.

ID=201204
Please find me as quickly as you can. Promise!

ID=201301
You and I are one and the same. We coexist together.

ID=201302
I swore an oath to protect you!

ID=201303
Remember that. You and I are one and the same.

ID=201304
Please find me quickly. I’ll never forgive you if you come too late.

ID=201401
You are me. I am you. We exist together as one.

ID=201402
I made a solemn promise to protect you!

ID=201403
Never forget. We belong together.

ID=201404
Remember that! Find me! Do you understand?

ID=201501
We arrived in this world as two, but we remain one and can only exist together.

ID=201502
I made a solemn promise to protect you!

ID=201503
Remember that! We are one!

ID=201504
Promise that you will look for me.

ID=201601
You and I are one and the same.

ID=201602
I made a solemn promise to protect you!

ID=201603
Never forget that. You and I belong together.

ID=201604
I’m begging you. You have to find me.

ID=201002
What on earth...!

ID=201003
Hey quit moping, pull yourself together!

ID=202001
What are you doing?

ID=202002
Edgar! You’re here!

ID=202003
Flood this world with your mannequins and become their king!

ID=202004
No. Let me.

ID=202005
Huh?!

ID=202006
I don’t want to be king.

ID=202007
I’m just a humble entertainer, a clown. It’s my job to make ‘her’ laugh.

ID=202008
Edgar, what are you saying?

ID=202009
I should never have given you an ego.

ID=202010
I don’t like your methods. They are abhorrent.

ID=202011
Edgar... err... Edgar?!

ID=203101
Do you want to save that child?

ID=203102
The only thing we can do for her is help her to find peace.

ID=203103
If you swear to stay with me to the end of days, I will give you my power.

ID=203104
You could use that power to help her find peace.

ID=203105
I promise! Give me your power.

ID=203106
No more!

ID=203107
You are now bound by your promise.

ID=203108
Aaaah!

ID=203201
Hey, you! Need any help?

ID=203202
I have something good for you. The power to help the child find peace.

ID=203203
But nothing in this world is free.

ID=203204
Do you promise to stay with me forever?

ID=203205
Then I will impart my considerable powers to you.

ID=203206
Well? What do you say?

ID=203207
I promise!

ID=203208
Give me your power!

ID=203209
I knew you would say yes. You are now bound by your promise!

ID=203210
Waaaaah!

ID=203301
The child simply won’t die. Can you put an end to it?

ID=203302
Such a crying shame! You’ll never manage with your current power!

ID=203303
Promise me. Tell me you want this power.

ID=203304
Do that and I’ll give you the power you need to kill this child.

ID=203305
Fine. Give me the power!

ID=203306
All right. You have made your eternal promise.

ID=203307
Aaaah!

ID=203401
Do you want to save that girl over there?

ID=203402
You know what you have to do.

ID=203403
You can only help her by gifting her eternal peace.

ID=203404
If you give me your eternal promise, I’ll give you the power you need.

ID=203405
I promise! And may the blame rest on my soul!

ID=203406
As you wish. Your promise is now binding.

ID=203407
Waaaaah!

ID=203501
I warned you. I told you it would hurt.

ID=203502
If you do nothing, the child will only suffer ever more. You don’t want that... do you?

ID=203503
Give me your promise. Swear an oath, and you’ll get the power.

ID=203504
You can free that child of its agony!

ID=203505
I’ll do it. I’ll do anything you want!

ID=203506
Just make it stop!

ID=203507
Good. Swear that eternal oath, here and now!

ID=203601
The child can never return.

ID=203602
The only hope we have is to grant it eternal rest.

ID=203603
If you want to put an end to this torment, you’ll have to swear an oath.

ID=203604
Say you want to have this power.

ID=203605
Yes, give it to me! I promise, just give me the power!

ID=203606
I’ll take everything you can give me!

ID=203607
Our contract is now sealed.

ID=203608
Now fight as you see fit.

ID=203609
Waaaaah!

ID=203001
Thanks.

ID=204001
Suzie, we meet at last.

ID=205001
No, Suzie. Get up! Wake up, Suzie...

ID=205002
Suzie!

ID=206001
Stop it, you creature from another world.

ID=206002
You shouldn’t be here.

ID=206003
Return to the Void!

ID=206004
The time nears. The time when you will be awakened.

ID=206005
Noooo!

ID=206006
The time has come for the wheels to turn.

ID=206007
Let us only hope you do not fail.

ID=700001
Daddy? Daddy... ?

ID=700002
Catherine! How are you?

ID=700003
Daddy, where are you?

ID=700004
Here, my child, here. Come, come to me.

ID=720001
Cath... Catherine? Catherine!

ID=710001
Come here, Chii. Have a cuddle, munchkin.

ID=710002
Ugh, Aruel! That’s not a cat! That’s a stinking SoulDreg!

ID=710003
No! Chii is my little kitty!

ID=710004
It’s okay. Chii is a good girl. If she is mean to someone, I’ll talk with her...

ID=710005
Oh... oh no, the SoulDregs! There’s too many.

ID=710006
Run for your lives!

ID=710007
Chii... Chii... Is it you?

ID=710008
Ah little Chii... Aruel can’t play with you anymore...

ID=710009
You are a good girl... you’ll soon find another human to look after you.

ID=710010
Go, go now! Before the monsters come and get you.

ID=710011
I’ll be right behind you.

ID=710012
Aruel... Aruel...!

ID=710013
I’ll look after all of you.

ID=710014
From now... to eternity.

Serving Nihil's throne means fighting with devotion and never running away!\nAll living beings should kneel before Nihil's Throne.

ID=401002
Aquamarine knights, may your services be immortalised for evermore in the Halls of Fame!\nYou who write Nihil's story – not one of you will ever be forgotten!

몸에서 팔이 떨어지면 분신이다. 이 명제를 반복적으로 학습 시켜놓으면.

ID=302003
몸에서 팔이 떨어졌다는 전제만 보고 아무런 의심 없이 분신이라는 결론을 내기 마련이지.

ID=302004
그럼, 단지 사람들을 속이고 싶다는 이유로 저한테 팔을 잘라달라고 했던 건가요?

ID=302005
정말… 제정신이 아니네요.

ID=302006
하하, 제정신인 것 만큼 지루한 것도 없거든!

ID=302007
너도 어때? 이왕 이렇게 나온 거 좀 더 재밌게 살아보지 않겠어?

ID=302008
아뇨, 전 지루한 걸로 충분해요.

ID=302009
쳇… 재미없기는.

ID=301001
어윈 씨… 어윈 씨?

ID=301002
저, 드디어 알았어요.\n왜 기분이 나빴는지, 무엇을 착각하고 있었는지… 모두 이해했어요!

ID=301003
이 사람들도… 이 공백 안에 있는 사람들도… 모두 공백이나 마찬가지예요…\n인간이 아니라, 공백의 일부였어요!

ID=301004
전부 죽여야 했어요! 전부!

ID=301005
아하… 아하하하하…

ID=301006
역시, 내 생각이 틀리진 않았네.

ID=301007
말했잖아, 그렇게 웃는 얼굴이 잘 어울린다고…

ID=303001
Ah... haha. Hahahaha!

ID=303002
It was really amusing. I've never had so much fun.

ID=303003
Looks like it really wasn't just a bluff.

ID=303004
If I'd just been able to move my arm for a bit longer... \nThen I would certainly have kept fighting.

ID=303005
Truly impressive.

ID=303006
Practically every living creature is frightened of death. It's quite unusual that you're not even a little bit fazed.

ID=303007
I have no intention of begging for my life.

ID=303008
So! It's time you end my fruitless life!

ID=305001
Wh... why?

ID=305002
I was wondering where you were hiding and I find you playing this children's game.

ID=305003
Who do you think you are?

ID=305004
What do you want from me?\nHave I done something wrong?

ID=305005
I want to have friends too... \nTo go to the zoo...

ID=305006
Why are you saying I can't do anything?

ID=305007
Because you're not a human, of course.

ID=305008
I'm... not human?

ID=305009
And because I'm not human I can never be happy?

ID=305010
Yes, of course.

ID=305011
Then I'll destroy everything as well...

ID=305012
You've taken it all from me... \nSo I'll destroy everything.

ID=305013
Hehehe. Ahahaha!

ID=305014
Just you try it, you monster girl!

ID=403001
후후후…

여기까지 수고 많으셨습니다. 소울워커 여러분.

ID=403003
역시, 제 눈은 틀리지 않았었군요.

ID=403004
당신은 누구죠? 저와 아이들에게 해를 끼칠 건가요?

ID=403005
아니요, 전 그저 마중을 나왔을 뿐입니다. 여왕님.

ID=403006
부디, 제 손을 잡아주시지요.

ID=404001
대단하군요, 이 정도일 줄은 몰랐습니다…

ID=404002
역시 소울워커는 적당히 봐줄 수가 없네요.

ID=404003
로이 씨에겐 미안하지만, 역시 당신을 살려두는 건 위험...

ID=404004
크윽… 이건!? 로스카?!

ID=404005
그대가 도착한 곳은 예정의 끝.

ID=404006
준비되어 있던 선로의 종착점.

ID=404007
그대의 앞에 존재하는 것은 걷히지 않은 안개.

ID=404008
안개의 뒷편에 존재하는 것은 깊이를 모를 어둠.

ID=404009
수많은 예정과 계획을 지나

ID=404010
떠나야 할 이들은 사라져갔습니다.

ID=404011
하지만 이곳까지 온 그대라면

ID=404012
다시한번 제가 본적 없는 미래로 나아가겠죠.

ID=404013
자, 고개를 돌려 주변을 둘러보세요.

ID=404014
그대들은 서로 다른 세계에서, 다른 운명을 걸었고

ID=404015
같은 선택을 하여, 같은 결과에 도달하였죠.

ID=404016
이제부터 만들어지는 것은 그대들이 걸어가는 이야기.

ID=404017
발을 내딛어 아무것도 보이지 않는 앞으로…

후, 후후후후…

ID=404019
로이 씨, 이거 곤란하게 되었습니다.

ID=404020
아무래도, 일이 굉장히 어려워질것 같군요.
