Can’t I kill him? Yes, I know. Relax.
Be careful? I don’t have the time for that. This is enemy territory.
What’s this about?\nI have to catch Henryk and apologise to Catherine.
Stop it! Do I look like I’ve got time for this?\nWhy do you think I’m here?
I need to kill them all anyway, right?

I don’t know who you are,\nbut you do a poor imitation of Chloe.
You don’t sound like her,\nso you might as well give up right now.
A terrible hobby.\nDo you have so little self-confidence that you have to copy others?
You! You’re not Chloe!\nI can hear it in your voice!
Who are you?\nStop trying to talk like Chloe. That makes me really angry!
Who are you?\nVoice impersonation not your forte, is it?
You’re not Chloe.

You lack empathy. Who are you?
Hahaha. How brazen. You don’t sound anything like Chloe!\nHow about you show your true identity?
I can tell by your voice, so out with it!

I liked ‘I Need Money’.\nShouldn’t it be finished by now?
I liked ‘Chrome Mask’ and ‘The Green Tea Prince’.\nThey were romances, but true masterpieces.
I don’t like mangas.\nI prefer artistic works.
I give Radialman and Two-Punch Man a thumbs up!\nHaha, reading them was all vectors and close-shaves!
What’s that? Something like fairy tales? \nI like ‘The Swordfighter of Oz’ and ‘Elisabeth in Wonderland’!
Comics? No, thanks! I prefer my edition of the Cat Encyclopedia.

No? You worked together so closely and yet you don’t even know what her face looks like.\nIs there a reason for that? The most likely one is that she isn’t human.

Just see how she reacted. She’s hiding something.\nSo don’t trust her too much, Original.

ID=40674
Abel... Even if you’re right and Chloe\nis not really human...
You have a complete lack of manners, boy.\nYou’re always interfering!
What do you mean?\nDo you want to meddle in my life, too?
I’m speaking the truth.
You think you can’t trust somebody, just because you can’t see them?\nThat’s rubbish, Abel.
That’s funny.\nShe puts up with so much, including my temper. Is Chloe not human?
Really? What’s that got to do with it?

But everything that happened between us\nis real and not a lie.
A human who laughs with me, gets angry and cries is supposed to be an AI?\nIf you say so. That sort of AI is welcome any time.
Who cares if she’s a real person or an AI?\nI trust Chloe utterly.
I don’t care if Chloe is an AI or otherwise.\nI’m on her side!
I don’t have to see her myself to like her and trust her. \nWhat matters is what I feel, not what I see.
Endurance: it is a virtue exclusive to humans.\nA virtue... or a curse.
Even I, a cat, can live among humans.\nI can talk with people.

She’s my comrade and was always at my side.\nSo you don’t need to go telling me that sort of thing.
Mind your own business and leave me alone.
I like her. And you have no right to interfere like that.
So you can say what you want. Nothing has changed for me. Got it?
She trusted me and likes me.\nAnd that makes Chloe my friend. A friend whom I trust.
In that respect, you assume wrongly. Stop that nonsense.
Machines and other beings can also get along with people!

Chloe. Are you hurt? What is it? Is Abel back?
So... Sometimes boys pretend to be girls on the Internet.\nBut you don’t, right?
Everything will be okay! Surely even a machine can be okay.

To get to space you have to reach beyond the skies.\nIt’s not for me.

So that was the last one?\nYay! What about the machine? Does it work?
Ready!\nIs the machine running?
Deliver report: The third SoulPath Marker has been installed!
That was the third! Reeaady!
So, the third one’s ready too.\nAnd? Is it all working?
That was three… I think it’s over.

Sorry, but this time no games in the fight against the Illusion!\nGladly, of course!
And I really don’t understand how you could see my earlier self, pah!
Switch your brain on and put yourself in my place!
I just like humans, whatever you say!
So when you act like that to me, you’re no different to those annoying adults!

Clenched fist?\nIs this Illusion some kind of trauma for you?
Please, old friend.\nIt’s just an Illusion, you’re killing that child there for the second time.
Indeed. You friend dies because the people beat her up so badly.\nYour saddest memory!

You can still beg for forgiveness...\nIf there’s even a shred of conscience left in you!
Everyone hates you, Amad.\nDon’t you want to reconcile with everyone, hmm?
It’s still not too late, so let’s go.\nThen I’ll let you live.

Wonderful.\nThen I don’t have to hold back.
In that case, I guess I have no other choice than to destroy you.
So you don’t want any reconciliation.\nWell then, you don’t deserve any forgiveness either.

Chloe! It's great to have you back!\nI've missed you, too.
Hey, I know that voice! G'day, petal!
So, who have we got here, then?
Well if it isn't our Chloe! Welcome back.
Aaaah, Chloe! Hellooooo! Heeeeello!
Hey... well... hehe.

It's going okay!\nYou know how it is, I never run out of missions.
As always there was laughing and crying.\nYes, it's a shame you weren't there.
Yeah, it'll make for some great stories...\nWell, you've got to learn from your mistakes, haha.
Oh yes, there were some really nasty opponents! We dealt with them!
Oh, I always get by.\nBut this is a bit too high up for me...!

Lieutenant Colonel Aaron! I respectfully ask for some time to think about this.

ID=51528
Don't worry, I'll handle it. The others can keep a safe distance.
Don’t wet yourself. I'll have it all taken care of before you can even spell 'squad'!
No need to worry. I'd already dealt with worse at a tender young age.
It's nothing! The squad will only have to sit and twiddle their thumbs, I'll make sure of it.
Are you scared? Stella will take all the ouchies away, don't worry!
Maybe I'll finally break a sweat today.\nNothing's going to happen, I'll keep an eye on them.
I'm already getting busy with these monsters!

Yes, the old guy is making himself quite unpopular.
When a hole's been ripped into your family, all you can do is suffer.

He's always so agitated. Poor guy...

I gave the Lieutenant Colonel my word.\nHe needs me now. Thanks, anyway.
No, no no! Uncle Aaron needs lots of biscuits right now!\nI'll keep an eye on him!

It's difficult to understand, but...\nThere's something much worse.
You must believe me. In the Void there were much worse things.
There were indescribably horrifying things in the Void.
In the Void, I was alone with something very evil.
You weren't there, but there was something horrible in the Void.
I saw something awful in the Void.
Call it a mood.\nBut I hate, hate, hate SoulDregs.

All the people who had to die...\nI couldn't avenge them all.
You know, in the Void you learn one thing in the end.\nYou either have spirit... or you don't.
These creatures will obliterate all living things.\nIt's my desire to exterminate them before that.
I would never have dropped to my knees...\nWhat I felt there is still in my bones.
The old man says we've got to destroy it!\nBut no one can say whether I'll do it on my own.
What lies ahead of us is quite something.\nBut fear cannot hold us back.
That won't change.\nBut it's about more than that now. How far can I go? Which opponent will triumph in the end?

We mustn't underestimate the SoulDregs.\nBut when we get a chance, we've got to take it!
Just look at those wretched things.\nWe can't have them running around!
These foul creatures before us are no exceptions.\nI'll exterminate them with pleasure.
I'm not afraid of fear anymore.\nI'll go forth as shield and weapon.
Now I'm completely certain!\nI want to defeat all monsters without exception.
What would life be like without challenges?\nWe SoulWorkers wouldn't have any work to do.
I will be the strongest... monster and protect you all from others.

Erwin Arclight gladly heads into the abyss.\nThat's the way you know me, Chloe! Right, partner?
While there's even one SoulDreg in the world, I'll fight.
The stronger my opponent, the stronger I'll become!
I'll get stronger and stronger. And so I'll protect more and more people!
With your faith, you lend me great strength.
Please let me fight side by side with humans for a long time to come.

Phew, just a little later and the cargo would have been lost.
That means they're lost without a leader.\nHave a look where they've scattered to.
With or without a leader, they attack as if they were rabid.
Good, good, that's that solved then!
The head rolled off, didn't it? All the others gave up?
No more monsters are kicking up a fuss, are they? \nNow I can finally... *retch*
I hate SoulDregs!

I fought against more robots in the Ruin Fortress. That wasn’t a problem, either.
Apparently I’ve seen too many of them. It’s almost as if I could see their structure.
As always. I get such a bad feeling when I cut them to pieces.
It helped, having fought against a lot of them in the Ruin Fortress. That was no problem.
It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a machine friend. But I finished them all off.
Well, that was sufficient for a warm-up.
I don’t care how many of them come. I’ll finish them with ease.

But in the end, negotiations with the rebels didn’t go well.

Your words seem so pointless now that you’ve burnt everything to the ground yourself.
That’s a lie. If you had really been thinking about your family, you would have escaped straight away.
Pff, the longer I look at you, the more repulsive you appear to me.

If revenge is more important than your own family, then you’ve got no right to talk about family.
We wanted to save you and that’s your response?\nI’ve got no sympathy for you anymore, just die.
But there’s no turning back now.
You’ve ruined everything.\nYou see everybody else as the enemy and you wanted them to die.

The battle against the Nihil’s Throne Bashai is beginning!\nWe don’t have any sort of information about these enemies. So please watch out.

ID=51875
All right.\nIf my opponents can bleed, then I can kill them as well.
I can gather data during the fighting.\nOne or two fights and I’ll have the right strategy.
It should be so difficult, even if the enemy can’t die.
It’s fine! I’ll manage.
All the others are protecting me, so it’s no problem! I’m ready!
Don’t worry! Compared to being afraid of heights or seasickness, this is nothing!

I’ll even help you later, so no rush!

The boss made a personal appearance?\nHmm, he can hardly chicken out if his lackeys die.
Is the commander not the greatest weak point?\nGood, it was starting to get boring.
So that’s the famous commander.\nIf the talk with him goes well, we could finish the battle.
Oh! Can you use the energy to fire off a large energy beam? I’d like to see that!
Ah, the famous commander... This could end more quickly than I thought.

Maybe we could end the battle if we say that we’re also looking for the Queen.
If a conversation was possible, we could find out their objectives and gather information.
In the event that we’re pursuing the same goal, we should be able to reach an agreement somehow.
Shouldn’t we try to talk with them if they’re pursuing the same goal as we are?
But we’re also looking for the Queen.\nShouldn’t we work together, then?
We could also sit back and leave the work to them.

It could be a trick to win our trust.\nBut they’ve risked too much for that.

The way things look, they haven’t planned anything special this time, either... Haha.
Well... it’d be rather embarrassing if the boss fell into their trap.
That would be great! Even if it turns out to be a trap, I’ll finish all of them.
I should think everything will go smoothly this time as well, but I’ll be careful.
Everything’s bound to be all right! Don’t worry too much about it.
That would be even better. I imagine they must have already taken too many losses for that.

Show yourself, then I’ll fight you!
Nice big mouth you’ve got there for someone who just hides away.
Aha. I’d really like to end this quickly, so why don’t you come out and fight!

If you don’t want all your comrades to die at my hands, you should step forward.
So much senselessness wrapped up as loyalty... You’re not so very different to humans.
In short... You want to save your own skin. Bah!
You mean to use your soldiers as a shield? How unscrupulous of you!
Boohoo! Scaredy-cat!
Oh, all mouth and no trousers, hmm?

If the commander dies, the soldier’s morale will break. They would be wiped out in a very short space of time.

ID=51962
So then they’ve all got to die. What a shame...
Sounds sensible.\nSo first I’ve got to slice my way through your troops to knock you down.
Then I’ll send all of you to your deaths.\nI was planning to do that anyway.
Then I’m going to have to fight my way through somehow to get you!
Then I’ll punish you for as long as it takes the nice commander to come forward!
Well, he’ll come out all by himself if I let rip.
So you’ll only come out when your troops have been obliterated?\nNothing easier than that.

네, 정말로 걱정할 필요는 없을 것 같아요.\n제 대신 자료도 엄청 모아주고 계세요.
별문제도 아니고 아무 문제없어.\n진짜 잘 싸우긴 하네.
네, 아직 별다른 구조 신호는 없는 모양이군요.
네… 굳이 제가 가서 지키지 않아도 될 정도입니다.

뭘 그리 성급해? 머리에 한 발 정도 박는 건 그리 오래 걸리지 않아.
아무리 그래도 목을 떨어트릴 정도의 시간은 있겠죠.
네, 알겠습니다. 개인적인 복수보다 사람들을 지키는 일이 훨씬 중요하니까요!
괜찮아! 영감님이 있으니까 둘 다 한꺼번에 할 수 있어!
돼지 한 마리 살처분할 시간 정도는 줘도 되지 않나요?
안 돼, 헨리는 무슨 일이 있어도 죽이고 갈 거야.

그럼, 모두 정의로워!\n돼지를 키운 사람도! 사람을 구한 사람도! 돼지를 먹어 감사할 줄 아는 사람도 모두!
알았어, 그럼 정답은 사람을 살린 녀석.
…그럼 모두 정의롭다고 할게.\n결국 사람은 아무도 안 죽었잖아.

…그렇다면 사람 살린 쪽이 정의롭다고 할게요.\n무엇보다 사람의 목숨이 중요하니까요.

네가 포기한다면 나도 싸우고 싶지 않아.
먼저 시비건건 너잖아.\n나라도 이따위로 싸우고 싶지 않았다고.
사람들을 죽일 생각인 당신이 할 말은 아닌 것 같군요.
죽이러 온게 아닙니다.\n당신이 더이상 후회하지 않도록 막으러 온겁니다.
그레이스에 있는 많은 사람들이 울고 있어.\n지금도 제레미를 위해 울고 있어.
먼저 우리에게 칼을 드민건 너잖아?\n우린 널 막을 뿐이야.
나도 이렇게 싸우고 싶지 않아.\n하지만, 사람들을 위협하는 넌 막아야만 해.
