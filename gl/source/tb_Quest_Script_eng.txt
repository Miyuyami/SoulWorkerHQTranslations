15 Years
Reality had changed. \nThe world before me was different.\nAccording to Miriam I had returned to consciousness after 15 years of deep sleep. \nI took it for a joke, but her eyes were full of compassion. Something terrible had happened. \nMiriam sensed that my mood was sinking and quickly introduced me to others. Seoni, for example, who contrary to Miriam, seemed expressively cooled. \nHer poise and way of expressing herself spoke volumes.\nShe was not happy to see me.

Seoni explained it to me begrudgingly.\nA child has been spotted in Control Zone 43. A troop was dispatched with Miriam, but after a SoulDreg assault, she was now cut off from the outside world. Could it have something to do with the strange pack?\nThe corps did not have any troops available, so Seoni asked for my help.\nBut why me? An indescribable feeling took hold of me, to know my aid was decided upon over all others. I had to go.

There were terrible monsters, the SoulDregs.\nMiriam was barely alive. I ran through the horde to her. There stood the child, the one who had protected us in the escape. \nIt brought us to safety. But then the wall broke apart, a large wolf spiked Miriam to the ground and swallowed the child.\nIt was then that the child’s words came to me.\n‘You are I and I am you...’\nI had to save the child at all costs. \nEven if I died trying.

Another talk with Miriam. \nThis time we talked about SoulWorkers and SoulForcers.

The curses took a form. \nReports mentioned a giant wolf in Control Zone 43. Miriam suspected that it was the wrathful wolf that had pursued me.\nThe code name of the wolf was Greedy Zoon: a being that as a SoulDreg was counted as amongst one of the most blood-thirsty and mighty Malevils around.\nHe had already ravaged an entire village. Miriam advised me to team up with Wilba, who had already been sent out. Together, we should come up with a strategy to defeat the Greedy Zoon.

He watched the fight and as Kairon was clearly facing defeat, this clown completely destroyed the wolf. \nHe looked at me. I was to join him on stage soon. And with that, he was gone. \nHis grotesque mask and glowing blue silhouette brought me great unease.

Someone just needs to lure Big Plastica into the location far enough away that makes for a suitable trap. That’s where I came in.\nI activated the scan device which gave me details on R Square, and then Tommy came to me, directly prior to the decisive battle with Big Plastica.

Whilst Big Plastica was in R Square, Rucco Town was attacked by more mannequins. These were different mannequins.

A scouting party did not return. Benjy asked to carry out further investigation.\nWe should first find the scouts who disappeared in the restricted sector.

There were some problems with the water supply in the underground tunnels. \nShade said nothing, as the city was being kept alive by the capital of the NED Company.

It’s spreading...
Catherine was in a terrible state.\nAccording to Luke III’s investigation results, she was infected with the Arachness’ Pike and was already half-transformed into a SoulDreg.\nLieutenant Colonel Aaron felt tremendous guilt as he saw his daughter suffering and blamed Luke III for not protecting her properly.\nCatherine put on a brave face and tried to act as if nothing had happened.\nWas there no way to get Catherine back?

Antidote
Catherine was visibly weakening as time passed.\nAs I slowly became convinced that we truly had no other option but to sit and watch, Shade took me to Henryk. Henryk, who had only animosity towards Shade, was already in the process of shutting her out but Shade, resolute, simply talked over him.\n\n‘I have a favour to ask’.

Pleading
At Shade’s request, Henryk informed her of the antidote.\nFor this, Shade promised to destroy all the dirt they had gathered on the NED Company. \nHenryk was surprised that a SoulForcer could be infected by Pike. The antidote was in N-102 Shelter. \nYet the interior of the lab had become a shelter for SoulDregs.\nWe searched in vain for the antidote and came back with empty hands. Then Shade asked after Luke III.\nHe had disappeared.
Destroy Defence Pupa in Deep Brand. Then investigate the Giant Capsule in the central lab.

Deep Regret
A change occurred in Luke III as he took in Catherine’s appearance. The bundled regret within had him combing through the entire lab for an antidote before he then intended to return to Catherine upon finding it. \nI chased after him and saw as Luke III was captured by the SoulDregs and then encased in a pupa.\nOnly a little time later and Luke III had mutated into a SoulDreg.

Muffled Voices
After saving Luke III, there was no rush to return to the lab. \nLuke III had found the antidote and used it. In the claws of the pupa, he also discovered something. \nFrom within the pupa, a strange voice spoke. It sounded so clear and soulful, more so than any human ear would have ever heard.\nHis suspicion: these voices initiate the mutation process to SoulDreg.\nAs we had the antidote, there was nothing standing in the way of questioning Henryk. He had to deliver answers.

Not Ready
Henryk confirmed the efficacy of the antidote, but without another ingredient, it was useless: the DNA of SoulDreg Mad Manic, the one who had set up the lab as a hatching ground.\nIt dawned on Luke III that perhaps the NED Company had planned all along to draw Mad Manic into their camp, so that they then had the monopoly on the antidote for the SoulDregs. This insight came too late.\nTo gather Mad Manic’s Secretion, explosive charges had been placed in the lab on Henryk’s orders.

The Secretion
We hurried back to the lab to use Mad Manic’s Secretion to complete Catherine’s antidote and to blow the lab sky high.\nWith great effort we managed to defeat Mad Manic and gather the secretion. Then we blew the place up.\nWe watched the explosion. One thing was certain: the NED Company will not be carrying out any more inhumane research. Not in Candus City, at least.\nNow Catherine needs to survive the treatment...

Hope or Downfall?
Luke III asked Henryk for the mixture formula for the antidote, but it was much simpler than first thought. It just needed to be stirred.\n Henryk did not want to be disturbed any more and then refused a further meeting. Luke III and I brought the finished antidote to Catherine. \nAs always, Catherine would not stop pestering the others. \nCatherine tried her hardest to resist as Luke III tried to inject the antidote into her. It was not until Aaron appeared that she gave in and allowed it to be done.

Their Opinions
Luke III reported the events in the pupa to Aaron and asked whether people were turning to SoulDregs in Rucco Town already.\nSeoni said that Voy had some information on that.\nVoy explained that once a NED Company employee had been kidnapped by SoulDregs in Rucco Town. On his return, he was infected, and had claimed to hear strange voices. As the voices disappeared, he became a SoulDreg.\nOn my return to Candus City, Shade asked to speak with me.

Danger Draws Closer
Shade explained that an invasion of an unbelievable amount of SoulDregs was taking place outside of the city. The city inhabitants had been evacuated using the NED Company transport airship. Yet the switchboard for the air raid bunker did not work and needed to be triggered manually. \nAaron was already waiting as, upon Shade’s command, I triggered the switchboard and returned.

Drawn Up as if by Magic
As Aaron heard the news from Rucco Town, he immediately gave the order to find and inform Luke III.\nLuke III was very worried for Catherine as he heard the tales of previous turners. As there was currently no solution to the problem, he wanted to even put Catherine into a hibernation style coma, until she could be treated in Starry Forest’s lab in Grace City. I followed Aaron to the air raid bunker in which Catherine was being kept.\nHer situation was visibly worsening.

Deterioration
Luke III asked Catherine if she still heard the voices.\nCatherine did not admit it at first, but with the urgent pleas of Luke III, she eventually said the truth. \nLuke III was not able to answer Catherine’s question. To keep Catherine calm, the truth had to be kept secret. Upon my return, I spoke to Aaron. \nA hasty return to Grace City was necessary.

The Great Escape
As the preparations for the escape reached completion and Aaron wanted to board the transporter, the SoulDregs attacked. Aaron was injured in the process. \nEven after the victory over the attacking SoulDregs and reaching the transport, Aaron’s thoughts continued to circle around his daughter Catherine. He was really worried about her.\nWhy did so many SoulDregs appear?\nCould what the Shade said really be true? Because of Catherine...?

Even in the transporter, it wasn’t safe. \nBoth in the air raid bunker and in the air, SoulDregs had pushed their way into the interior of the transporter. \nEven the Soul Reaver at the manor had recommenced their pursuit of Catherine. Fortunately, he was be kept away from Catherine.\nWhy are these SoulDregs chasing Catherine?

We thought it was over.\nBut the supposedly dead Soul Reaver had not given up on his pursuit of Catherine. \nJust as the voice seemed to have disappeared, the Soul Reaver took Catherine as a hostage and she became the Malevil Amaryllis.\nIts power was incomparable. It seemed Amaryllis... Catherine could not be held back.\nThe child reappeared. We renewed our oath. \nThis new power finally gave me the strength needed to soothe Catherine.

A Bitter Price
Henryk’s antidote was not a true antidote.\nIt was a substance that induced the SoulDreg transformation, based on the DNA of Mad Manic. As Aaron found out about Henryk’s treachery, he sought for him. But Henryk had long since disappeared.\nA mercenary of the NED Company, Bamz, was the only one who did not know about it. \nHe said that Henryk had climbed into the private jet very happy and then escaped.\nWe need to get back.

The Fall
After a long and deep sleep, a strange light hit my eyes: the town was rubble, the sky wrapping it in an ominous darkness.\nCold sweat ran down my limbs, yet before the images could make any sense, a pale child stood before me.\nHe looked at me and said I needed to follow him.\nI had to follow him. His face...\nHis face was weirdly familiar.

Dark wolves lurked close by, as I followed the child.\nSuddenly, a mighty weapon appeared in my hand.\nI had barely defeated the wolves when I heard human voices.\nI pushed on in the direction of the sound and hoisted myself into the transporter, whose engines started turning.\nA giant wolf, white as the moon, took up pursuit.\nAs the beast prepared to make its killing pounce, I broke apart. Time stood still and I lost consciousness.

Examination
A man, Benjy, asked me if he could carry out a test on me.\nLike it or not, I had to agree to his almost extortionate plea.\nWith brisk pace, he led me to the testing grounds, Steel Graves.\nMy test started with operator Chloe’s voice in my ear.\nI would be told the exact circumstances of this much later.

Physical
The test content was straightforward. \nOne test concerned my physical condition. The other... this test of my combat capabilities exceeded all my expectations.\nThe test robots disintegrated under my attacks.\nThe environment did not look like the real world either... it seemed more like some game.\nBut if it was a game, Chloe’s reactions were most strange. \nDid something unusual happen here?

Final Test
After the victory over the training robots, the giant robot, Steel Boss, appeared. \nHe was larger and more mighty than any that I had faced so far.\nHe could crush humans...\nBut even this monster fell easily to my attacks.\nDid something not go according to their plan? Chloe was speechless with regard to the power that I showed on that day. \nHas this special power always lurked inside me?\nIf so, why did it wait till now to show itself?

The test now lay behind me and I was back.\nThey told me that my power burst the stress capacity of the facility and had led to errors within their inner mechanisms.\nThey said there wasn’t much else I could do there.\nI had to head over to Rucco Town, a town nearby.

City of Grace
Pursuing Henryk led me to the city of mercy, Grace City.\nThis town was unbelievably peaceful.\nToru, the acting Commander of Grace City, was not able to officially support me as a result of the partnership with the Starry Forest League and the NED Company.\nUnofficially however, I was to urgently find evidence of Henryk’s crimes.\nI introduced myself to the Starry Forest League as we would have to work together for now.\nThere, a strange main caught my attention.

Protecting Hands
His name was Maverick. He was a SoulWorker too.\nThere were more SoulWorkers before, so that more than one could be placed with each company.\nI found out that there was a specific reason for the death or disappearance of almost all the SoulWorkers.\nHowever, this reason eluded me.\nTogether with Medo, who claimed to idolise me, I introduced myself to Yop, who belonged to the support unit. I then returned to Toru.

The Bashai
The Bashai. Just as with the Blue Clown from Rucco Town, Mad Edgar, these are beings from another dimension that have a grasp of human language and possess a human form.\nToru explained that in the coming quests, an encounter with the Bashai is unavoidable, and send me out to the motorway to get to know them.\nOne of the Bashai forces that were currently near Grace City was the Firestream Battalion. They are always chasing greater power.

When I started to get impatient with the pursuit of Henryk, Toru said that I should go for a walk to get some fresh air.\nAfter speaking to Lex, the honorary doctor in the weapon development department for Starry Forest League, I was introduced to Nathan. He belonged to the mysterious wealthy elite, that support the Starry Forest League with tremendous capital.

Unwilling Rescue
Ava urgently explained that clues as to Henryk’s whereabouts have been discovered.\nHenryk has put Candus City behind him. His car was discovered on the motorway.\nBut why would his car be on the motorway that is teeming with Bashai?\nIt was not the right time for such thoughts.\nTo catch Henryk, I would have to go everywhere.\nEven if it could be a trap.

The Gammashai’s Cry
The car was empty.\nA folder within the car held a USB stick.\nIt contained data on Catherine... Amaryllis.\nSimple files. No evidence\nagainst the NED Company.\nThere was however an encrypted file.\nThe decryption would take a long while and I needed to eliminate the leader of the Firestream Battalion, Sukkarak.\nAfter the victory, I realised that I needed a NED Company device to decrypt the file.\nToru and Ava wanted to ask Yop for help, as he knew of a division leader at NED.

Friend
Rawper, division leader of the NED Company Secretariat and also friend of Yop, made a suggestion.\nIf we wished to push into the offices of the NED Company, which Henryk has almost definitely entered, to find him, Rawper will bring a device that allows us to decrypt the USB stick.\nThe offices of the NED Company had been taken by the Firestream.\nTo get to the next floor, the Firestream need to be defeated and the lifts in the building need to be put back in operation.

The Search for Light
Rawper explained that there was a method to activating the main generator in the NED Company offices. For this, the 4 sub generators need to be manually operated.\nDoing this will temporarily activate the main generator and the lifts will then be available for use.\nThe key for the security box required for the decryption is in the building.\nI returned once the main generator activated and the key secured.

Appetite for Destruction
Henryk’s tracks of needed to be investigated on the top floor of the NED Company, and the USB stick coupled with the security box.\nBut beforehand, Yop wanted to report to Toru and Ava. Yop told more about Rawper’s behaviour.\nAnd of a trap.\nBut Ava was all about the destruction.\nWithin the NED Company was the commander of the Firestream Shock force, Naomin. Ava demanded the USB decryption and the elimination of Naomin.\nAva also suggested we ask Maverick for advice prior to the mission.

Maverick said that his advice wouldn’t help much,\nas I was using a different weapon and also that I had a different combat style.\nThe NED Company’s NBRF elite forces would help with connecting the USB stick to the safe. We’d barely done this when Naomin, commander of the Firestream Shock forces, appeared. A fight broke out.\nNaomin left the battlefield with words along the lines of ‘the time has come’.

The USB stick had been decrypted and the file sent over to Rawper.\nI had the feeling I had been conned, yet I wanted to believe that Rawper would share the information.\nYop was worried that something could go wrong, but Medo did not believe that Rawper would cheat Yop.\nMedo sent me to Sora to learn more about the relationship between the two of them.

Sora explained Yop and Rawper’s past to me.\nShe was just as certain as Medo:\nRawper would never go behind Yop’s back.\nRawper learned that Henryk was actively supporting Amaryllis’ plans. The NED Company would also like to locate Henryk.\nHe also wanted to support the elimination operation of the Firestream Storm troop, ‘Wolf Cry’.\nWhen I explained this to Ava, she merely snorted.

Ava did not like the behaviour of the NED Company. As soon as something went wrong, they pull out at the earliest opportunity.\nBut she was happy that the company wanted to support operation Wolf Cry.\nI was to be the driving force behind this, as without me the operation would not even be happening.\nIn the centre of Wolf Cry was the sonic wave rockets F-ARIA and the elite tank Mountain Troll. I went to the Heavy Artillery weapons soldiers, that were responsible for the operation.

The operation was a huge success. More than 80% of the Gaour unit was eliminated.\nQueen Gaour, favourite of Vice-Commander Falconai, was torn out of the sky.\nMaverick explained that he didn’t want to take all the credit away from the newbie, and pulled back.\nI prepared for the fight against Queen Gaour.\nQueen Gaour disappeared as the situation started to get too dicey for her.

It was well known that Falconai, commander of the Firestream Storm Troop, really prized Queen Gaour.\nAva was convinced that Falconai would charge on us when he found out that Queen Gaour had been injured.\nThe report came in that Falconai had appeared on the second motorway.\nTo bring the operation to an end, I faced Falconai.\n‘The foolishness you show in not recognising your true enemy will cost us all our lives...’, Falconai’s final words echoed in my mind.

After the enemy troops had been defeated and I didn’t have anything too important to do, I wanted to take a short break.

I discovered a place known as Deaf Town, which is close to Grace City.\nAlmost 300 people disappeared there.\nWide-reaching searches led by Maverick, leader of the reconnaissance team, had so far had no success.\nAva send me to Deaf Town, to search for clues.\nThere were left behind clothes scattered all over the floor and the burning eyes of the Firestream Battalion glowed in the cold rain.

At first glance, there was nothing unusual about the clothing that I had brought from Deaf Town.\nI brought it to Sora to investigate.\nShe discovered that there was human flesh stuck to the inside of the clothing.\nSora sensed the seriousness of the situation and begged Lex for a more precise analysis of the situation.\nLex took the clothing with an unusually serious disposition.

It was definitely human skin stuck to the inside of the clothing.\nLex suspected that an overdose of SoulForce may have flowed into the humans and then exploded. The body is presumably vaporised in the process.\nSoulPath Markers have been set up in Deaf Town to measure the SoulForce values in the area.\nDuring the operation, we came across code name Taifon, a Firestream machine that vaporises humans and absorbs the SoulForce.

Lex said that he had seen Taifon’s components at a NED Company technology conference. Ava suspected a cooperation between NED Company and Firestream and wanted to get Rawper to answer some questions.\nRawper did not believe the company to be treacherous, but then Ava showed him the components. He recognised the NED Company tech within the suction tubes.\nHenryk invented it.\nThis proved Henryk’s treachery.

In a change to our first encounter, Sukkarak now radiated a powerful aura, as he had merged himself with SoulForce and a Bashai. The energy summoned by Taifon was transferred completely to Sukkarak.\nSukkarak had forgotten his pride, yet he still seemed to doubt his new strength and was losing the fight.\nA most wretched Bashai, who had lost his drive. Sukkarak fell to ashes and disappeared.

Rucco Town had no forces left thanks to the battles against the remainder of Mad Edgar’s mannequins.\nIn Candus City the SoulDreg elimination operation was still in progress. Aaron, who had lost his daughter, and Luke III were beset with a most murderous mood. I did not talk to them.\nSupport was not to be expected from anybody, so I returned to Grace City.\nToru had the same impression.\nHe gathered as much men as he could in Grace City to attack the Firestream base.

Various methods were applied to scan the interior of the secret base.\nHowever because of the disruptive signals coming out of it, so far there had been little success.\nFor this reason the plan was to install an EMP bomb in the centre of the base that would only hit the system emitting the disruptive signal.\nThis operation was a success and the interior of the facility was scanned.\nAll that was left was revenge.

Cold Air
Maverick and I followed the Blood SoulWorkers to Ruin Fortress, a former military fortress of the NED Company. Within the steel fortress, total silence reigned. There was not a soul to be seen, the fortress was empty.\nThe Starry Forest League was already there. After a short introduction I got a status report.\nAs the unit had been put together quickly, the facility itself had not yet been fully investigated.\nMaverick sighed in disbelief.

Their World
The camp and facilities were soon investigated. The only problem was energy supply. The electricity supply was intact, but the access to it was locked.\nAmanda suggested that it was controlled by an AI. The AI control system supervised facilities of this size.\nWithout the energy supply, the search for the Blood SoulWorkers was stalling. We had to find the AI.\nWe discovered the AI’s location and also the empty Blood SoulWorker shuttles. They were already roaming the Ruin Fortress. The next target was the AI... Lucy. She was our enemy.
Ask about the current whereabouts of the Blood SoulWorkers.

Crafted Resentment
Frances said that an AI with its own consciousness has more than just hardware. Multiple sub AI cores act in support of the AI’s central core.\nLucy could not be hacked and was not cooperating. We wanted to destroy and then reprogram her.\nThe operation led us right into the heart of the enemy. The situation came to a head when Maverick was called back to Grace City because of an emergency.\nI pushed in, destroyed the sub AI cores and waited. Yet nobody in the camp could hack into them. Then a boy appeared.

Where’s Mummy?
The boy was a refugee, who had been left behind somewhere in the Ruin Fortress. His name was Abel. Despairing and scared, he stood there. I felt sorry for him, so I took him with me and returned to the camp.\nA fight ignited between Avon, who did not trust the boy, and Amanda, who wanted to question him.
Talk to the Strange Boy.
Speak to Abel.
Speak to Abel in the Ruin Fortress.

Their Saviour
Abel was the son of a researcher, who had played a part in the development of Ruin Fortress. His family had lived there until the accident. Since this accident, nobody lived in the Ruin Fortress anymore. Abel had survived on emergency rations in a secret room.\nAbel’s details on his past seemed to add up. He knew how the energy supply in the Ruin Fortress could be activated. Lucy was an AI that took on the workload from the humans. If she is deleted, then we take back control.\nWe formatted Lucy, but there was another problem.

Three for One
We had control, but we were lacking the energy needed to operate. All we could do was open and close doors.\nFrances said that the facility was once a fortress. For this reason, there is no external power source. Abel confirmed this.\nRuin Fortress used the Buster Core as a source of energy. Three slave cores then served to generate the energy. By activating the slave cores, the Ruin Fortress would once again have a supply of energy.\nWe were able to activate the slave cores and restore the flow of electricity to the Ruin Fortress.
Activate the first slave core.
Speak to Frances.
Speak to Frances in the Ruin Fortress.

Unanticipated Troublemaker
There is a new problem. If a slave core was operated by a stranger, then the other two consider it as an enemy and block it.\nFor this reason, Frances wanted to also destroy these two slave cores, as with Lucy. As there was no option to activate these slave cores as allies, the energy loss had to be accepted. Nobody knew what the Blood SoulWorkers were up to. This search took priority.\nAfter the slave cores were destroyed, a great deal of noise came from the camp. Abel has disappeared.
Get the Buster Core under control.

The Boy’s Motives
We located a sign of Abel in the depths of the Buster Core. What did he want there and why did he disappear? But first, we had to secure his property. \nChloe was acting strangely throughout the search. The moment I was certain she was not being herself, I asked her to spill the beans. But suddenly Abel appeared by the control unit. We were surprised as Abel appeared in the Buster Core.\nHe was a Blood SoulWorker.

War & Blade
Abel said that we had taken a load off his shoulders and then disappeared. We chased him and reached the depths of the Buster Core. Abel was absorbing their energy. As I moved to stop Abel, the Blood SoulWorker Nita blocked my path.\nThe battle drew on a long time and Abel was able to absorb the entire energy load of the Buster Core before he escaped with Nita.\nI returned to camp and saw the pale faces of the people there.

Follow the Light
Without power the facility could barely be kept under control. In spite of this, we had to continue the search for the Blood SoulWorkers and follow Abel.\nAbel had absorbed the wave-formed energy in the Buster Core. We followed his tracks and discovered a sign in the underground sector. He seemed to be luring us.\nThen I saw the shuttle route. It did not seem to be wide enough...\nAt the end a large door blocked the path and I returned to the camp.

Sudden Encounter
The door that blocked the path was locked. So I took a different route. Just as the search was getting boring, the following happened:\nWe ran into a NED Company troop in the shuttle route.\nThe battle was short. The troop leader was able to escape, but an old man remained, stood still and speechless. He seemed to be not confused nor scared. He was very calm, as if he had waited for this moment for a very long time.

The old man’s name was Dr. Stoph. He was a professor at the NED Company and was well-known as a bio-technologist throughout Cloudream.\nHe would not reveal why he had approached the Starry Forest League. I left him in peace and returned to the Shuttle Route.\nBlood SoulWorker Naran was waiting at the large door.\nAs with Nita, Naran did not use her full strength in combat. She said she had another ace up her sleeve. Then she fled.\nI checked the energy reaction levels behind the door and recognised Abel’s Buster Core energy.

Bloodlust
There was a massive arsenal of weapons behind the iron door. There were weapons stored there whose production had been banned by convention. This was evidence that the NED Company had prepared for a war against the Starry Forest League from the very start.\nI got new information from Amanda. The measured energy reaction was stationary.\nThis had to mean that Abel had halted with the Buster Core energy to prepare something else.
Proceed to the Weapons Arsenal.

I had to clear out some unmanned robots before I managed to reach the depths of the Weapons Arsenal. Waiting for me there was a giant robot that only had an upper body.\nOnce I had destroyed this giant robot, controlled by Abel, he removed the core and made his escape. Then he said something strange:\n‘We will meet, finally...’

I wanted to question Dr. Stoph about Abel. But he stayed silent. Avon stopped trying to gather more information and ordered the elimination of the Blood SoulWorkers. Dr. Stoph jumped in surprise. He begged us to wait. The time was not yet right.\nDr. Stoph believed that Abel intended to head to the real source of energy in Ruin Fortress, the Deep Core.\nWe reached the Deep Core beneath the Ruin Fortress. It reminded of an endless abyss.
Proceed to the Deep Core.

Deeper and Deeper
Abel had absorbed the Buster Core energy to activate Worker Ex Machina. As he had required my SoulForce for this, he attacked me.\nThe anti-SoulWorker weapon Worker Ex Machina absorbs the SoulForce of SoulWorkers when it fights them.\nAbel intended to activate the Deep Core with this energy. As only SoulWorkers can activate the Deep Core, there are only SoulWorkers on the NED Company Board.\nAbel is an artificial SoulWorker. He does not have any characteristic energy.\nWhatever he intends... we have to stop him.

Glowing Flower Queen
Nita was waiting for me in the Deep Core. Unlike the previous encounter, this time she unleashed the true power of a Blood SoulWorker. She even activated her Blood Nova to stop me.\nSomehow I managed to overcome this might, but the Deep Core had already been activated.\nSuddenly, things went very quiet. Then a tremendous tremor shook the Ruin Fortress.\nAccording to Amanda, this tremor was the result of the drive being activated... but what will happen now?

Bloodbath Witch
The excavator Castle Fiend was the cause of the tremor. Seven of these excavators built Ruin Fortress in just a month. Abel wanted to use this to wake up Blood SoulWorker prototype Suzie.\nSuzie was the strongest Blood SoulWorker to date and had eradicated all life in the Ruin Fortress. If she wakes, it would be the end.\nIt was unbelievable. But the escape of the NED Company was the proof.\nTo stop Suzie’s resurrection, the Castle Fiend had to be stopped.\nWithout accounting for Abel.

Castle Fiend’s power was increasing. It couldn’t be said where the boundary of his power lay.\nI reached the place where the Castle Fiend dug out of the ground. But it was already too late. With a light that seemed to split the sky apart, Suzie rose to the surface.\nIn a flash, both Abel and Suzie had disappeared.\nIt was a spark of fortune in the depths of dark misfortune that Suzie seemingly had not come to her full senses, a side effect of the disempowerment. It was not yet too late.\nNot yet.

As I pushed into the military research centre to secure Suzie, I bumped into Naran. She said that Abel and Suzie were with her and that we should end this, for once and for all.\nI hurried to the location, but it was all a lie. Abel and Suzie had already fled to a safe location and Naran was trying to gain time by activating her Blood Nova.\nIt was very discomforting to know how much time I lost there.\nThe others felt the same way.

We entered a drying plant. We had to stop Abel and prevent Suzie’s full resurrection.\nThe Ark was a secret project of the NED Company, made to create SoulWorkers.\nSuzie was a Blood SoulWorker prototype who had wiped out the entire Ruin Fortress.\nProject leader, Dr. Stoph realised that these creatures were also merely children.\nHe wanted to gift them a normal life.\nA spaceship had been built in the drying plant that we were to halt the awakening of the Bloodbath Witch.

The Confession
Dr. Stoph had disappeared. It happened on the way to the drying plant of the Ark Ship.\nAmanda supported his intention to get involved himself. Dr. Stoph would die in the process.\nHe was to pay for the experimentation. But Avon felt he should live on and repent for his actions.\nI hurried to the Ark Ship to save Dr. Stoph. Jayoon of the NED Company was with him. He had heavily injured Dr. Stoph. I defeated Jayoon and hurried to help Dr. Stoph.\nBut I was too late. He lamented his idle spectating and closed his eyes.

Seal away Suzie. Leave the remaining Blood SoulWorkers alive. The targets were clear. The preparations were in progress. I went to the Ark Ship.\nAbel was defeated and Suzie almost sealed. But Abel let out a cry and Suzie awoke. Furious. Unreachable. I was completely helpless. As Suzie attacked, a golden light burst out around us. Then nothing more.\nJust a familiar voice... and then black. In the camp Avon asked what happened, but I did not know. I asked myself the same question.

The World’s Axis
I visited Maverick. He had to deliver answers. Yet he also did not know of a woman in golden armour. Maverick suggested that I seek out Shiho.\nShiho explained. The woman’s name is Lakasha. A being much like a god, and the source of SoulWorkers.\nShe had chosen me to save the world, once. But with my salvation, she broke a promise never to interfere with the world. The Blazing Voids had existed ever since.\nShiho said that I needed to gather my strength. I was to enter the Blazing Void.

The story so far...
When the din of battle had faded, nothing was left except dusty air and emptiness. It was as if Suzie and all the other Blood SoulWorkers had been swallowed up by the ground. \nSuch powers had collided in the battle between Suzie and that strange golden creature that a blazing void had formed. We lost the Blood SoulWorkers’ trail in the ensuing chaos. The investigation team from Ruin Fortress and I pursued another trail: a gigantic blazing void that we could now enter with no trouble.

Impenetrable Void
We carefully made our way into the Blazing Void. Corruption and devastation stretched away before our eyes and the sky glowed with a sinister light. Nothing moved. The Great Void had drained the last drop of life from the city.\nThe investigations were progressing at full speed on the other side. The SFL commander introduced me to someone who had returned from the dead five years before: Tenebris, the first of all SoulWorkers. The legend began with him.

The first thing we came across in the Blazing Void were the Bashai from the Firestream Battalion, who we’d already encountered in Grace City. I thought the Void had sucked them in just as it had those helpless people before. But Tenebris saw things very differently.

Strange Voices
The SoulPath Marker were rendered inoperable. SoulForce couldn’t be recognised and Amanda, who'd taken over communications, began to hear strange voices on the line. The Void had been waiting for us. What were we to do?\nI continued slogging onwards and kept coming across remnants of the Firestream Battalion. Then I saw the unforgettable entity from long ago: Codename Taifon. The enemy was leeching energy with these monsters. I quickly destroyed all the Taifons I could reach.

All of the strewn Firestream Battalion monsters had been defeated. Time to breathe out, even in the Blazing Void. This meant the Luckforce Med Squad could be stationed securely and we even finally exchanged a few words with Miriam again. But something in her was unsettled. Did she knew something about Tenebris and was keeping mum?

Greed Territory
Tenebris listened attentively to my report. All of this wasn’t unusual in the void, this was SinForce territory after all. It draws in all in its path, till all logical thought ends and only lust remains.\nAvon replied that it was indeed curious how SinForce and SoulForce could collide without the latter vanishing. Tenebris wasted no words on the subject.\nMiriam was no longer trying to get through to Tenebris. Things seem very complicated.

The illusion sector was still active and obviously the one and only had to show up: Mad Edgar. I was still brimming with rage at our last encounter. So I went back into the illusion sector to defeat his last illusion once and for all. I’d barely set foot in the sector when I heard a totally foreign yet familiar voice speak to me words heavy with meaning.

To Each Their Own
According to Tenebris it was the voice of my Shadow Walker, a kind of manifested past. Since it wasn’t possible to listen to this voice without complications, Tenebris said, I should leave the area as quickly as possible.\nShocked by this news, I turned to Miriam for advice.

Then Toru received an urgent message.\nA new incident in the Void.\nGrasscover Camp received reports of SoulForcers disappearing one by one.\nAmad’s interrogation continued, but we couldn’t accept any more damage. The decision was taken to return to Grasscover Camp together with Maverick.

Of course, it was Tenebris, who was now over there slurping his coffee.

Most of the SoulForcers were back in safety. But the next steps were unclear, because no one could estimate the risk.\nAnd the few aides had moved out of the Void, which made proceeding further a lot harder.\nAvon appealed directly to me. Would I still carry on fighting?\nOf course. I came to fight. Avon, Amanda, Miriam, Lex and Maverick assured me of their support and said we would advance side by side.

Dipluce of Legends
Aaron was lost the moment Henryk's name dropped. Nerve by nerve, he inched towards breaking point, but he kept listening to Veneris' words.\nHenryk had gone into hiding in Dipluce, the port city steeped in legend. He was hoping he could win over the SoulDreg queen for himself, in order to wipe out humanity for good.\nShade urgently warned us of the horror that would await us there. But Aaron was not be dissuaded from his pursuit of Henryk. And so I, too, had no other choice.

And the horizon sank.
Dipluce Horizon was destroyed. Not a trace of the port city's great beauty remained to be seen. Darkness drifted over the place and the SoulDregs were spreading their plague.\nThe desolate hole at the docks gaped at us, toothless and eyeless, only a few steps away from the water. I didn't want to put up our tent there at all. Shade wanted to tackle the highest building to secure the camp. She was right... damn.

Panic Stricken
The last security rampart was now standing. Having just returned to the quarters, Aaron's temper flared and he gave one of the soldiers a rollicking.\nHis offence had been to dare ask for a different post. Aaron didn't stop swearing. No war could be led this way, let alone won.\nAt times like that, every one of us was cannon fodder.

The World of the Unholy
In silence, Aaron contemplated the amulet with the portrait of his daughter. He had changed. With a cold inner rage, he lost more and more of the fatherliness with which he had always lead us.\nThe report about the massacre that he had arranged with our troops hung over the camp like a stale shroud. With foresight, Shade had been able to rescue some of those doomed to their deaths. There was hardly a trace of the fighting spirit we had at the start.

We then busied ourselves with the larger SoulDregs lurking between the buildings. These places didn't constitute any important positions but Aaron insisted we gather more battle data.\nAgain he was sending us into the fray without any apparent battle plan. And we followed him blindly.

Calm Before the Storm
Once the camp was set up, every movement was concentrated on the eerie sink-hole on the pier, or the Unholy Hole as we called it. Its depth was immeasurable and we would find ourselves in an unsecured danger zone. In order to get the equipment necessary for the descent, we went to see Major Toru in the Ruin Fortress.

In the Ruin Fortress, Toru asserted that he had seen Blood SoulWorkers there. He was so sure about it that he didn't even crack any jokes. But Avon didn't want to know.\nWhat on earth was going on here? My mission was pressing, however, and so I made my way back to Dipluce Horizon just as artfully as I had before.

Disobedience
He was there... The soldier that Shade saved from certain death during the last mission. He was talking to Greywell.\nGreywell made no secret of his anger towards Aaron, but with Shade's words of encouragement he didn't do anything stupid. Not yet.\nIn this constricting atmosphere, Luke suddenly came bursting in with his unwavering urge to push ahead with the research using the fallen... It felt like we were in the wrong film.

Aaron's dreadful moods took became more and more violent in nature. He held Shade personally responsible for the fact that he couldn't relax during the rest period, and shouted incessantly at anyone who crossed his path.\nFor how long would we be able to hold the camp under this atmosphere? The tension was gradually becoming unbearable.

The monotone construction of the camp and the concentrated preparations for the descent became more and more of a torment. Then it happened. One of the ships set sail with a team, without having received orders to do so.\nVeneris insisted we push on with the preparations, and let the deserters go. But as Lieutenant Colonel Aaron's amulet was nowhere to be found, the situation boiled over completely.

거대한 구멍의 아래
강하기의 설치가 성공적으로 끝나고 이제서야 조사를 시작하게 된 싱크홀. 그 아래를 강하하며 우리들이 발견한 것은 과거에 네드가 소울정크 실험에 이용한 것이라 생각되는 어느 과학실이었다.\n베네리스는 이 과학실을 먼저 조사하는 것에 대해 불만 가득히 반발했지만 퀸과 네드가 과거에 벌인 짓들에 대한 자세한 조사를 강행했다.
