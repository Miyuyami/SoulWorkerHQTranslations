The place where a member of Starry Forest League tests their battle ability. \nThe robot remodeled for tests waits for a member of the Starry Forest League.

ID=15001
To help the children, Miriam runs to the bowling site where construction was stopped. But it’s isolated due to the attacks of the soul junk which showed suddenly...

ID=15002
“Dread”, the Soul Junk which moves around the bowling site .\nThe main culprit destroyed a hospital in Warren, which in turn pushed Rocco Town \nover in fear of an infectious disease. I’ll take care of it before it spreads.

ID=15003
I have come to the bowling site by Miriam’s request.\nI have to find and rescue the survivors who were isolated by the \nSoul Junk.

ID=15004
Ryu went to the site alone in order to verify the information which showed an awakening body. I don’t know what’s going to happen.\n I will join him quickly.

ID=15005
The Clown’s invitation leads toward the Street Plaza. \nWhat kind of present waits for me there?

ID=15006
The streets of the square are almost filled with dolls. \nWhat was once a vibrant town \nhad now become a town dominated by emotionless dolls.

ID=15007
The NED company support helicopter is needed to stop the advancement of the Big Puppet. I have to stop the dolls before they destroy the helicopter.

ID=15008
Operation [Shield]. The dangerous strategy which lures the Big Puppet out directly and makes it disintegrate itself in the safety shield. This strategy is a must in order to succeed.

ID=15009
New dolls appeared. \nThe search party that went on to investigate didn’t return... which gives \nme an unpleasant hunch.

ID=15010
People that became dolls, \n an eerie tower, and dolls that are moving restlessly... \n These dolls... why on earth is a doll building a tower?

ID=15011
It was none other than the tower that changed humans into dolls. \nBenjamin directed the destruction of the tower to prevent harm from spreading.

ID=15012
The doll speaks of the code name [Jack King]. \nThe only way to break through this situation is to beat the Jack King.

ID=15013
I finally found the weak point of the [Clown of Blue Flame]. \nHe set up camp in the Hospital Ruins near Rocco Town. I’ll look for the advance party and chase down the Clown of Blue Flame.

ID=15014
I need a badge to reach the Clown of the Blue Flame, but there’s no information of a particular badge. A doll in the hospital would probably have one. 

ID=15015
We arrived at the ward where the Clown of the Blue Flame is located. I made them neutralize a magnetic field using a badge, and we could finally advance.

ID=15016
“Edgar”, the Clown of Blue Flame who ran away, designated the circus tent on the roof of the hospital as the location of the last decisive battle.\n I have to beat him at all costs.

ID=15017
I barely had time to catch my breath when I arrived at the new city where I was tasked with another mission. I have to dispose of the Soul Junks on the coastal road to secure Candus City's supply route.

ID=15018
Information by NED company mercenaries confirmed that there is still a strong Soul Junk on the coastal road.\n They always seem angry, but...

ID=15019
There has been an increasing amount of mysterious earthquakes on the coastal road recently. Due to the risk of elevated roads and collapsed buildings, I have to find out the cause.

ID=15020
A group of Soul Junk appeared again. Commander Aaron directed the disposal of Soul Junk and the destruction of the coast tunnel, which is the only supply route, in order to defend Candus City.

ID=15021
I got permission from NED company and entered the underground waterway. It’s hard to \n breathe due to the intense stench.\n It certainly feels like something lives here...

ID=15022
The bad smell from an underground waterway stands at various places by the city and has begun to spread.\n It’s clear that the only cause of the bad smell is in the underground waterway...

ID=15023
Mercenaries and researchers from NED company were dispatched to an underground waterway, since it seems suspicious that Brock instructs their surveillance.

ID=15024
The emergence of Junk Knight has shocked all of Starry Forest League. In order to question NED Company into holding responsibility, Brock has ordered to attain a sample of Junk Knight.

ID=15025
It seems like a carrier ship of NED Company has crashed into a house nearby.\nWe need to investigate exactly what they were trying to carry.

ID=15026
The entire house has become a den of Soul Junk.\nThere is a Soul Junk with a high contamination rate nearby; we need to get rid of it before it gets out.

ID=15027
According to Ralph’s story, it seems highly likely that Catherine will be somewhere deep inside the house. Let’s move deeper into the mansion to look for Catherine.

ID=15028
The Soul Junk named Arachniss that took Catherine away\nseems like it’s hiding somewhere in the basement.\nLet’s quickly find and rescue Catherine.

ID=15029
The only antidote for Catherine’s Vacuum Vein infection is at the research facility of NED Company.\nBut that research facility was already a den of Soul Junk...

ID=15030
The second research facility was also crawling with Soul Junk... We don’t know what in the world happened here, but getting the antidote for Catherine is top priority.

ID=15031
Out of guilt for Catherine, Victor has gone to the research facility to find the antidote by himself.\nFind him before the Soul Junk do.

ID=15032
Henry says that in order to use the antidote, the slime from the Beholder is needed. He also ordered us to activate the explosion trigger to destroy the research facility.

ID=15033
When we returned from Rocco Town, Candus City was under attack by Soul Junk. We need to trigger the opening switch for the refuge center for people to evacuate.

ID=15034
A large number of Soul Junk has been discovered on the path to the transport ship located in the bomb shelter. For the safety of everyone, they must be dealt with.

ID=15035
Everyone has taken shelter except for Catherine and us. However, at that time, we discovered that there were a large number of Soul Junk near the transport ship.

ID=15036
The escape from Grace City has commenced. However, the Soul Junk’s unrelenting attacks are making everyone anxious.

ID=15037
I wanted to chase after Henry, but was ordered to gain some experience fighting against the Veshi. I have no choice but to follow the orders for now.

ID=15038
Rapid Flames, a brigade that reveres the greed for power, is looking for every opportunity to invade Grace City through the highway.

ID=15039
The supposed vehicle carrying Henry has been spotted. The information is a bit unreliable, but he must be arrested at all costs. At least, before the Veshi get to him...

ID=15040
「Scar」of the Rapid Flame Faction has appeared on the highway. In order to find out Henry’s whereabouts, Scar must be defeated and interrogated.

ID=15041
The NED Company headquarters was raided by the Rapid Flame Faction after Henry sneaked inside.\nAlthough I’m reluctant to do so...\nHe must be rescued.

ID=15042
NED Company’s building was cut off from electricity\ndue to Rapid Flames taking over the building. 

ID=15043
In order to repair electricity for NED Company,\nit looks like one has to manually activate the switch inside the building.\nRapid Flames seem to have the key to activating the switch.

ID=15044
In order to retrieve evidence for the incident at Candus City,\nwe need to copy all the data\nfrom NED Company’s security box.

ID=15045
In order to defeat the Rapid Flames coming in from the second highway, we need to take back the firing zone “Hill Breaker” for Operation Wolf Cry to commence.

ID=15046
Operation Wolf Cry involves firing missiles called 「Final Aria」which spreads strong radio waves in its vicinity. With this, we can exterminate Queen Carla, the main force of the assault brigade.

ID=15047
Heel Breaker can not progress towards the Area Missile firing zone. With Starry Forest League’s Soulworker 「Kainbarrel」, defeat the Rapid Flame’s assault squad.

ID=15048
The Assault Captain of the Rapid Flames, Falcon, has finally showed his face after his precious bird Queen Karla has been damaged. To the target that has finally showed its head, we can almost feel grateful for it.

ID=15049
While the entire village was vacant and an eerie silence was all that was left, the rain falling down on Dave Town had a gloomy feeling.

ID=15050
「Dave Town」, a town located near Grace City, is inhabited with many people due to the fact that it is away from the front lines and can therefore can sustain itself.

ID=15051
Situation where I hope for the best. To find the path for Souls within Dave Town, we need to install the 「Spirit Path Finder」as fast as possible.

ID=15052
The situation has turned for the worst. What is it that they are trying to accomplish with these acts? But for now, finding survivors is top priority.

ID=15053
The alliance between Henry and the Rapid Flames has become reality. Henry must pay for the crimes he has committed.

ID=15054
The supposed stronghold for the Rapid Flames was a trap set up by the NED Company and the Rapid Flames.

ID=15055
Due to the NED Company’s trap, the majority of the forces at Grace City has been wiped out. This crisis has put the city’s existence on the line. We can not let everyone die.

ID=15056
The Rapid Flame faction’s Assassination squad is hindering the rescuing process of backup. We need to defeat these enemies in order to rescue many people as possible.

ID=15057
The remnants of hacking on military satellite Indra by NED Company has been confirmed. We need to trace back through their hacking in order to learn their true motive.

ID=15058
The NED Company’s traces have led up to the mountains near Grace City. It is time for their judgement.

ID=15059
In order to find Henry and Raufa, we need to find the source of the radio wave that is disrupting the military satellite, Indra.

ID=15060
We’ve detected life signals indicating Henry and Raufa within Indra. This is the most ideal time for revenge.

ID=15061
A virtual training program designed for Soulworkers; it can simulate the monsters from the database, then an experience just like a real battle begins. However, since it spends a lot of energy, it can not be used frequently.

ID=15062

Come to “The Shopping District”\n, you’ll like it.\n - Clown Edgar.

Report on Amaryllis\n\n Soul Energy Resistance added to SJ-DS-01. Unstable.\n\n 2. SJ-DS-01 is parasitic to soul energy hosts. Contact to humans, fatal. The skin hardens and becomes food.\n\n 3. SJ-DS-01 is known as Dignity Snatcher. It sucks up soul energy. \nOrdinary humans possess very little.

That day was cloudy.\n The runaway child knew. Rather, I did not understand how the “calamity” came. We had committed crimes; we could of atoned for it. Yet, we did not. Unlike other children, I came to pass judgement...\n\n The cloudy day.\n The child was brought to death by humans. They had naive ideas that everything was over. Silly as I did, I thought NED company would help. They, will definitely bury the truth. As if nothing happened.\n\n  We were buried in hell. A fateful ending for us.

Befitting to its name, it’s a robot that detects Soul Energy within a object, recycle, and search for energy.\n\n2.It is currently in force shut down mode due to loss of energy. When energy is inserted in three times consecutively, it breaks out of shut down mode and starts up.\n(Requires 24 hours until it moves)\n\n3.If the Core is damaged or lost, an amplifying device can be replaced in to resurrect the Core.\n(Warning: Needs at least 1% power source left)
