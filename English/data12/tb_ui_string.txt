The place where a member of Starry Forest League tests their battle ability.\nThe robot remodeled for tests waits for a member of the Starry Forest League.

ID=15001
To help the children, Miriam runs to the bowling site where construction was stopped. But it's isolated due to the attacks of the soul junk which showed suddenly...

ID=15002
“Dread”, the Soul Junk which moves around the bowling site .\nThe main culprit destroyed a hospital in Warren, which in turn pushed Rocco Town \nover in fear of an infectious disease. I'll take care of it before it spreads.

ID=15003
I have come to the bowling site by Miriam's request.\nI have to find and rescue the survivors who were isolated by the \nSoul Junk.

ID=15004
Ryu went to the site alone in order to verify the information which showed an awakening body. I don't know what's going to happen.\n I will join him quickly.

ID=15005
The Clown's invitation leads toward the Street Plaza. \nWhat kind of present waits for me there?

ID=15006
The streets of the square are almost filled with dolls. \nWhat was once a vibrant town \nhad now become a town dominated by emotionless dolls.

ID=15007
The NED company support helicopter is needed to stop the advancement of the Big Puppet. I have to stop the dolls before they destroy the helicopter.

ID=15008
Operation [Shield]. The dangerous strategy which lures the Big Puppet out directly and makes it disintegrate itself in the safety shield. This strategy is a must in order to succeed.

ID=15009
New dolls appeared. \nThe search party that went on to investigate didn't return... which gives \nme an unpleasant hunch.

ID=15010
People that became dolls, \n an eerie tower, and dolls that are moving restlessly... \n These dolls... why on earth is a doll building a tower?

ID=15011
It was none other than the tower that changed humans into dolls. \nBenjamin directed the destruction of the tower to prevent harm from spreading.

ID=15012
The doll speaks of the code name [Jack King]. \nThe only way to break through this situation is to beat the Jack King.

ID=15013
I finally found the weak point of the [Clown of Blue Flame]. \nHe set up camp in the Hospital Ruins near Rocco Town. I'll look for the advance party and chase down the Clown of Blue Flame.

ID=15014
I need a badge to reach the Clown of the Blue Flame, but there's no information of a particular badge. A doll in the hospital would probably have one. 

ID=15015
We arrived at the ward where the Clown of the Blue Flame is located. I made them neutralize a magnetic field using a badge, and we could finally advance.

ID=15016
“Edgar”, the Clown of Blue Flame who ran away, designated the circus tent on the roof of the hospital as the location of the last decisive battle.\n I have to beat him at all costs.

ID=15017
I barely had time to catch my breath when I arrived at the new city where I was tasked with another mission. I have to dispose of the Soul Junks on the coastal road to secure Candus City's supply route.

ID=15018
Information by NED company mercenaries confirmed that there is still a strong Soul Junk on the coastal road.\n They always seem angry, but...

ID=15019
There has been an increasing amount of mysterious earthquakes on the coastal road recently. Due to the risk of elevated roads and collapsed buildings, I have to find out the cause.

ID=15020
A group of Soul Junk appeared again. Commander Aaron directed the disposal of Soul Junk and the destruction of the coast tunnel, which is the only supply route, in order to defend Candus City.

ID=15021
I got permission from NED company and entered the underground waterway. It's hard to \n breathe due to the intense stench.\n It certainly feels like something lives here...

ID=15022
The bad smell from an underground waterway stands at various places by the city and has begun to spread.\n It's clear that the only cause of the bad smell is in the underground waterway...

ID=15023
Mercenaries and researchers from NED company were dispatched to an underground waterway, since it seems suspicious that Brock instructs their surveillance.

ID=15024
The emergence of Junk Knight has shocked all of Starry Forest League. In order to question NED Company into holding responsibility, Brock has ordered to attain a sample of Junk Knight.

ID=15025
It seems like a carrier ship of NED Company has crashed into a house nearby.\nWe need to investigate exactly what they were trying to carry.

ID=15026
The entire house has become a den of Soul Junk.\nThere is a Soul Junk with a high contamination rate nearby; we need to get rid of it before it gets out.

ID=15027
According to Ralph's story, it seems highly likely that Katherine will be somewhere deep inside the house. Let's move deeper into the mansion to look for Katherine.

ID=15028
The Soul Junk named Arachnis that took Katherine away\nseems like it's hiding somewhere in the basement.\nLet's quickly find and rescue Katherine.

ID=15029
The only antidote for Katherine's Vacuum Vein infection is at the research facility of NED Company.\nBut that research facility was already a den of Soul Junk...

ID=15030
The second research facility was also crawling with Soul Junk... We don't know what in the world happened here, but getting the antidote for Katherine is top priority.

ID=15031
Out of guilt for Katherine, Victor has gone to the research facility to find the antidote by himself.\nFind him before the Soul Junk do.

ID=15032
Henry says that in order to use the antidote, the slime from the Beholder is needed. He also ordered us to activate the explosion trigger to destroy the research facility.

ID=15033
When we returned from Rocco Town, Candus City was under attack by Soul Junk. We need to trigger the opening switch for the refuge center for people to evacuate.

ID=15034
A large number of Soul Junk has been discovered on the path to the transport ship located in the bomb shelter. For the safety of everyone, they must be dealt with.

ID=15035
Everyone has taken shelter except for Katherine and us. However, at that time, we discovered that there were a large number of Soul Junk near the transport ship.

ID=15036
The escape from Grace City has commenced. However, the Soul Junk's unrelenting attacks are making everyone anxious.

ID=15037
I wanted to chase after Henry, but was ordered to gain some experience fighting against the Veshi. I have no choice but to follow the orders for now.

ID=15038
Rapid Flames, a brigade that reveres the greed for power, is looking for every opportunity to invade Grace City through the highway.

ID=15039

こんにちは。\n私、この入り混じりし世にて至極のショーを求め彷徨う「道化師エドガー」と申します。\n突然のお手紙に、さぞ驚かれたことでしょう。\nですが、あなたの力に感嘆を禁じえなかったこの思いをお伝えしたかったのです。\nあなたのその力は、短い我が人生の中でもっとも美しく印象的でした。\n華やかでありながら地味で、美しくも汚らわしい、\nそして…平穏でありながら破壊的な…。\nこの破裂しそうな私の気持ちをどう表現すべきか、悩んだ末に結論を出しました。\nあなたに…ささやかなプレゼントを贈ります。\nその力に対し敬意を表するという意味ゆえ、どうか拒否されませんよう。\nプレゼントは、あなた方が「ショッピングストリート」と呼ぶ場所で確認できます。\n願わくば…気に入ってくださらんことを祈りつつ。\n-道化師エドガーより-

ID=33001
少しずつ、あなたとの距離が縮まるのを感じます。\n遅かれ早かれ出会うことになりますが、\n待つ時間が長いほど、出会いの瞬間というのはすばらしく輝くものです。\nドラマチックな状況を演出するために、ちょっとしたゲームを準備いたしました。\n私がいる部屋の前へは、今のあなたの力では辿り着くことはできません。\nしかし、私の部下が持っているバッジを身につけたなら、 \n明け方の森の中を歩くかのごとく通過できるよう演出しました。\nお急ぎください。\nあなたを待ち焦がれるこの気持ちが、憎悪に変わるその前に…。\n-道化師エドガーより-

-レポート：アマリリス-\n\n1．SJ-DS-01にソウルエナジー耐性機能を追加。状態はとても不安定。\n\n2．SJ-DS-01は、ソウルエナジーの宿主である人間に寄生できることが判明。\n寄生対象となった人間は、ソウルエナジーを持続的に奪われ、皮膚が石膏のように固まってSJ-DS-01の食料となる。\n\n3．SJ-DS-01をディグニティースナッチャーと名付ける。ディグニティースナッチャーの内部に蓄えられているソウルエナジーの総量が存在することが明らかになる。しかし、平凡な人間は該当総量を全て満たす程のソウルエナジーを持ち合わせていない。現在の総量は測定不可。

-ある雲った日。\nあの子の暴走は予想していた。むしろ、それを「災い」呼ぶ者たちを理解できなかった。我々は罪を犯し、それを償う時がやって来た…ただそれだけだ。他の子らの代わりに、裁きを下しに来たのだ。それがもし復讐という名を持っていたとしても、私は甘んじて受け入れる。\n\n-ある雪の日。\nあの子は愚かな人間たちによって再び眠りについた。彼らは、あの子が眠れば全て終わるという甘い考えに染まっていた。ネッドカンパニーが我々を助けてくれるなどという愚かな考えに腹が立った。彼らはきっと、真実を知る者全てを葬り去るだろう。何事もなかったかのように。\n\n-ある晴れた日。\nこの施設の閉鎖が決まり、首脳部を除く全ての人間はこの地獄へ取り残されることになった。おそらく、そう長くは保たないだろう。罪深き我々の最後にはお似合いだ。…不思議な気分だ。あれほど怖がっていた死が、今はまったく怖くない。

Model Name：NS_EX_008\nName：Cleany\n\n1. その名の通り掃除専用ロボット。私物に込められたソウルエナジーを判別し、分別収集及び紛失物捜索に適する。\n\n2. 現在は動力喪失状態のため、強制スリープモードに入っている。エナジーを3回に分けて順番に注入すれば、自らスリープモードを解除し動き出す。\n(動作までに約24時間所要)\n\n3. コアが破壊されたり消失した場合、コアを取り替えた後に使用可能な増幅装置をコアのあった位置へ設置すると、コアが復活する。\n(注意：動力源が1%でも残っている必要あり)\n\n数少ないヒントでここまで至った方に、まずは感謝の意を表します。\nこのルインフォートレスで「人間」以外の者に罪はありません。\nこのロボットもまた何の罪もない存在です。\n「HELP ME」という文字に反応し、ここまで来たあなたなら、きっとこの子を受け入れてくれるはずです。よろしくお願いします。 \nそして、クリーニー。どうか、幸せに…。
