A testing ground for the combat skills of Starry Forest League soldiers. \nRobots modified for testing await the SFL combatants.

ID=15001
Miriam rushed to the drill site, where work had been halted to rescue a child. But the sudden SoulDreg assault cut her off.

ID=15002
SoulDreg Dradar roams the construction site. He is the culprit who destroyed Voy’s hospital and terrorised Rucco Town with an epidemic alert. Kill him before he spreads the plague.

ID=15003
Heeding Miriam’s request, you have just reached the drill site.\nSurvivors stranded here must be found and brought to safety.

ID=15004
Wilba went to the place where Malevil was sighted by himself. Who knows what’s going to happen, you’ve got to help him quickly.

ID=15005
The Clown’s invitation points to the deserted road of the main square.\nWhat gifts await you there?

ID=15006
Countless mannequins crowd the roads around the main square.\nA road that was once teeming with people and life\nhas turned into a road of soulless dolls.

ID=15007
To stop Big Plastica’s advance, a helicopter will be needed that happens to belong to the NED Company. The mannequins have got to be stopped before they destroy the helicopter.

ID=15008
Operation Starry Forest Shield\nA dangerous operation in which Big Plastica is lured into the defence wall and its self destruct triggered. The operation must not fail.

ID=15009
The mannequin faction has resurfaced.\nThe scout squad sent to investigate them hasn’t returned, either. You sense a sinister aura.

ID=15010
Humans who have become mannequins, a tower that emits a sinister aura, and mannequins labouring tirelessly...\nWhat are the mannequins building the tower for?

ID=15011
It was the tower that turned the people into mannequins.\nBenjy orders the tower’s destruction, before it can wreak even more havoc.

ID=15012
The talking mannequin, codename: King Wayangon\nThe only way to escape this situation is to defeat King Wayangon.

ID=15013
Finally, the Blue Clown has been tracked down.\nHe is in an abandoned hospital near Rucco Town. Find the vanguard and pursue the Blue Clown.

ID=15014
According to your info you need a special badge to reach the Blue Clown. \nYou can find the badge on the mannequin servants inside the hospital.

ID=15015
You reached the ward where the Blue Clown is based. The badge got you through the magnetic field, and you finally reached the Clown.

ID=15016
The Blue Clown, Mad Edgar, fled and challenged you to a showdown in the circus tent on the hospital roof. \nThe final fight begins. He must be stopped, whatever the cost.

ID=15017
You have scarcely arrived in the new town and you aren’t given a moment’s rest. The next operation is already underway: Clear out the SoulDregs on the coastal road to secure the supply route to Candus City.

ID=15018
The reports from NED mercenaries of another powerful SoulDreg on the coastal road have been confirmed. \nThey say he is in a constant rage...

ID=15019
Recently, the coastal roads have experienced inexplicable earthquakes. There is a risk that this might cause flyovers and buildings to collapse. We must find out what is causing the earthquakes and solve the problem.

ID=15020
Yet another pack of SoulDregs has shown up. To defend Candus City, Lieutenant Colonel Aaron gives orders to eliminate the SoulDregs and detonate the last remaining supply route: the coastal tunnel.

ID=15021
Given permission by the NED Company, you have reached the subterranean sewage tunnels.\nYou nearly choke on the stench.\nIt feels like something really is alive here.

ID=15022
Several parts of the city now stink like the sewers. It is evident that the source of the abominable stench must lie in the sewer system.

ID=15023
The NED Company has assembled a large squad of mercenaries and researchers and sent them into the sewers. Shade, who grew suspicious of their activities, ordered them surveilled.

ID=15024
The arrival of the Baalride shocks the entire Starry Forest League. To hold the NED Company accountable, Shade orders a sample procured from the Baalride.

ID=15025
You have learned that a NED Company airship has crashed in a nearby residence. \nWe must learn what was on board.

ID=15026
The entire residence has turned into a SoulDreg’s lair.\nThere is a highly contagious SoulDreg here. It should be killed before it gets outside.

ID=15027
Bamz says it is believed that Catherine is somewhere deep inside the residence. Go further into the residence find Catherine.

ID=15028
Supposedly, the SoulDreg Arachness who abducted Catherine has hidden deep below the residence. \nWe must find Catherine soon.

ID=15029
It is said that the only antidote to Catherine’s Pike infection is located within the NED Company’s laboratory. But the lab has already become a cave teeming with SoulDregs.

ID=15030
The second lab was a SoulDreg’s lair as well. Who knows what made these places change so drastically, but the priority is to find the antidote for Catherine.

ID=15031
Racked with guilt over losing Catherine, Luke III entered the depths of the laboratory alone to find the antidote. \nHe must be found before a SoulDreg gets him.

ID=15032
Henryk says that to be effective, the antidote requires secretions from Mad Manic, and he also gave orders to demolish the laboratory.

ID=15033
Right after returning from Rucco Town, a massive army of SoulDregs attacked Candus City. To rescue the people, the control unit for the air raid shelter has got to be opened.

ID=15034
An inordinate number of SoulDregs were discovered inside the air raid shelter and on the way to the transport airship. They have to be killed first to protect people from being attacked.

ID=15035
Most of the inhabitants had been taken to safety. Only we and Catherine remained. It was at that very moment we discovered a mass of SoulDregs heading toward the transporter we were supposed to board.

ID=15036
After leaving Candus City behind, our flight began in earnest. \nBut the pack of SoulDregs attacked the airship with tenacity. Everyone was extremely concerned.

ID=15037
Although there was barely enough time to pursue Henryk as it was, orders came down to bring back Bashai. The orders must be followed, for now.

ID=15038
The Firestream Battalion which lusts for power. The Firestream’s assault squad is planning to invade Grace City via the motorway and awaits its opportunity.

ID=15039
A vehicle that Henryk supposedly used has been found. Plenty of questions remain, but first we have got to save him before he is attacked by the Bashai.

ID=15040
No trace of Henryk, target of the revenge, but Sukkarak, leader of the Firestream Battalion, has shown himself on the motorway. To learn of Henryk’s location, Sukkarak must be stopped.

ID=15041
An urgent message has arrived stating that the Firestream raid squad took the NED Company office complex after Henryk penetrated the NED HQ. We have got to rescue him, unfortunately.

ID=15042
Since the Firestream captured the building, the power supply inside the NED Company has been erratic.

ID=15043
To restore power to the NED Company, it has to be activated by hand from inside the building. Evidently, the Firestream has the key.

ID=15044
To obtain evidence of Henryk’s deeds in Candus City, all data from the security box inside the NED Company needs to be copied.

ID=15045
This operation is about stopping the Firestream’s attack squad before they reach the second motorway. To activate Wolf Cry, secure the shooting position for the Mountain Troll.

ID=15046
Operation Wolf Cry’s target is to launch the high frequency rocket F-ARIA to neutralise Queen Gaour, the attack squad’s mainstay.

ID=15047
The Mountain Troll can’t move until F-ARIA is launched. Together with Maverick, a SoulWorker of the Starry Forest League, the Firestream attack squad must be stopped.

ID=15048
When his beloved mount Queen Gaour is wounded, Falconai, commander of the Firestream attack squad appears. Isn’t it glorious when an enemy so rarely seen in person shows himself?

ID=15049
In a deserted place where silence smothers the roads, the cold rain in Deaf Town only spurs the ominous sense of foreboding.

ID=15050
Deaf Town, a little town near Grace City, is home to many people. With the war far off, Deaf Town has retained economic independence.

ID=15051
One can only hope this foreboding will be gone with the rain. There is no time! The SoulPath markers have to be set up to discover how SoulForce flows through Deaf Town.

ID=15052
The ominous sense of foreboding became reality, after all. What are they after, doing such terrible things...? Well, we’ve got to search for survivors first.

ID=15053
And so it is that the alliance stands between Henryk and the Firestream Battalion. Henryk must be stopped and finally brought to justice for his unspeakable deeds.

ID=15054
The place believed to be the Firestream headquarters turned out to be a trap set by the NED Company working hand in glove with the Firestream.

ID=15055
The NED Company’s malignant stratagem placed Grace City in a perilous position from which it could not escape. We cannot let them die like that!

ID=15056
The Firestream’s kill squad is preventing the relief squad from carrying out the rescue op. If we are to save even one person, the enemies preventing it must be eliminated.

ID=15057
There are indications the NED Company hacked the military’s Indra satellite. We need to trace the hack to find its source.

ID=15058
The trail leads to a place near the mountains, in the outskirts of Grace City. It’s time to let them feel a punishing blade.

ID=15059
To locate Henryk and Rawper, the interference signal that is crippling the military satellite has to be shut off.

ID=15060
Indra’s scan of the facility interior shows two life forms, probably Henryk and Rawper. Finally the time has come to avenge them.

ID=15061
A virtual training simulator the Starry Forest League has developed exclusively for SoulWorkers. \nEnemies registered in the database are set up as holograms or robots to simulate a realistic combat situation. The simulator consumes a lot of power and can’t be used very often.

ID=15062
A zone that has been laid to waste by the Great Void.\nSoulDregs appear here constantly. The Starry Forest League has marked the area off limits to civilians.

ID=15063
The sudden appearance of the mysterious distortion unleashed countless mannequins onto Earth.\nNobody knows where they come from or how they managed to invade our world.\nAll we know is that they are powerful and hostile.

ID=16200
I awake from a 15-year-long slumber to find all hell has broken loose.\nMonsters roam and humans have supernatural powers.\nI find myself in the world I always dreamed of.\nIt’s all so unsettling, so different... so thrilling.

ID=16300
A world which has no room for the things we took for granted...\nWell...\nI never took anything for granted.\nI fought hard and bitterly for everything by the sweat of my brow.\nThat won’t change now... not even in this world.

ID=16400
They say a lot has changed in the last 15 years.\nThey say that survival is all that matters in today’s world.\nHuh... what can I say?\nSurvival has always been all that mattered to me.

ID=16500
When I opened my eyes, I was told I had been asleep for 15 years.\nDo they think I’m a bear that hibernates?\nThey keep talking about things I don’t understand. Plus, I’m starving, and nobody’s giving me anything to eat...\nHm... at least I’m with everyone else instead of all by myself.\nI guess that’s something.

ID=16600
The world I knew is gone.\nEverything seems to strange and unpleasant. I don’t want to stay here a minute longer.\nBut I’ve got to face it.\nThis is the world I’m going to be living in.\nI’ve got to persevere and tough it out.

Hello.\nMay I introduce myself? My name is Mad Edgar, and I am a humble clown who is always in search of the best of all shows in this turbulent world.\nI presume you are quite surprised about this message coming out of the blue.\nHowever, I really wanted to tell you just how deeply I admire your strength.\nYour power has been the most impressive spectacle I’ve ever seen in my short life.\nGlorious yet unassuming, beautiful yet ugly, soothing yet destructive.\nI have pondered long and hard on how to express my explosive feelings\nNow I’ve decided to send you a little gift.\nIt is a token of my reverence for you and your strength. Please do not decline it.\nYou will find the gift in the place you humans call the shopping district.\nI sincerely hope... that you like it.\n- Yours respectfully, Mad Edgar -

ID=33001
I can sense that we are getting closer to each other.\nI do not doubt that we shall meet soon.\nYet isn’t it likewise true that the longer we wait, the happier the occasion will be?\nI have prepared a little game for dramatic effect.\nYour current strength will not permit you to get past the place in front of the room where I am located.\nI have taken care to ensure that you can get past that place easily with the badge my servants carry.\nPlease hurry.\nBefore my heart, which longs for you so, is filled with hate.\n-Yours respectfully, Mad Edgar-

- Report: Amaryllis -\n\n1. Added SoulForce immunity to subject SR-Z-01 Condition: Unstable.\n\n2. Observed parasitism in subject SR-Z-01. Subject infects human SoulForce hosts.\nInfected hosts lose their SoulForce permanently. Symptoms: Skin like plaster.\nThe host merely serves as a source of food for SR-Z-01 now.\n\n3. Valid name for SR-Z-01: Soul Reaver. Additional finding: The Soul Reaver accumulates and stores the SoulForce it absorbs. However, the mass of SoulForce detected far exceeds the maximum capacity of a host, i.e. a human. The mass we are investigating currently exceeds the capacity of all our instruments.

ID=33003
- Report: Taifon -\n1. The fuselage is an apparatus assembled with utmost precision. Based on our data on Firestream battalion technology, we can conclude that we do not have the means to create a Firestream of our own with our methods. We hypothesise that an external force was used to produce it.\n\n2. The weapon fires highly concentrated SinForce.\n\n3. The armour includes a special wire and a crane which can lift 700 kg.\nWe estimate the armour’s attack damage to be devastating.\n\n4. The special wire is capable of storing and transmitting SoulForce.

On a gloomy day.\nThe child’s fury was predictable. It’s difficult to comprehend people who call this phenomena a disaster. The truth is, we have sinned and the time has come to atone for our sins. As the representative of all other children, the time has come to hand out just punishment. Even if it is called revenge, I will accept it as atonement.\n\nOn a snowy day.\nFoolish people have caused the child to fall into a deep sleep again. They took comfort in the thought that it would all be over once the child was asleep. The foolish belief that the NED Company would save us makes me mad with rage. They will bury everyone who knows the truth. As though nothing had ever happened.\n\nOn a clear day.\nAfter it was decided to mark this place off-limits, everyone but the management board was left behind in this hell. It won’t be long before everyone is dead. Indeed. We have sinned. It is only just to die like this. I do not fear what we face.

ID=33005
Model name: NS_EX_008\nName: Dusty\n\n1. As the name suggests, this is a cleaner robot. Measures the SoulForce in subjects. Suitable for sorting rubbish and searching for lost items.\n\n2. Currently in sleep mode because it is out of energy. If it is supplied with energy 3 times, it will reawaken from stasis and begin to move by itself.\n(It will take about 24 hours until it starts to move.)\n\n3. If the core is lost or destroyed: If an amplifier is found and inserted into the core position as a substitute core, The core can be reactivated.\n(However, it must have at least 1% propulsion.)\n\nI would like to thank the people who made it this far with the help of the notes.\nThe Ruin Fortress harbours no sinners, except... the ‘people’ here.\nThe same goes for this robot.\nI firmly believe that you, who have come all this way merely in answer to the words ‘HELP ME’, will look after this child as well. I need your help. \nAnd I need Dusty. May your path be blessed with happiness.

ID=40731

ID=40737
*yawn* I am going back to sleep. I’ll tell you how my dream continues next time! Byeeeee!

데자이어 워커 시절의 힘과 그때의 감정을 이끌어내어 현재의 자신과 융화한다.\n어디까지나 재현에 불과하기 때문에 데자이어에 오염될 걱정은 없지만 전투 능력에 별다른 변화는 나타나지 않는다.\n오직 내면에 존재하는 또 다른 자신을 경험하는 용도로만 활용할 수 있는 듯하다.\n\n※ 이퀄라이저 착용 시 데자이어 워커의 이펙트 및 보이스 적용.
