The true reality here was different.\nWhat lies before me was a world far from my own.\nMiriam said that it's been 15 years since I came to.\nShe doesn't seem to be lying based on her expression...\nPerhaps to change the mood,\nMiriam led me to a woman named Sunny.\nUnlike Miriam, she feels somewhat distant.\nJudging from her attitude and facial expression, that is...\nShe doesn't look very welcoming.

地下水路で出会ったネッドカンパニーの傭兵ラルフは、\nヘンリーの命令で他の研究員と共に、\n地下水路にある何かを回収しに来たようだ。\nしかし、ソウルジャンクの襲撃で仲間たちとはぐれ、\n地下水路の奥深くに取り残されてしまっていた。\n自分の身を守るので精一杯だというラルフから、\n取り残されている研究員の救出を頼まれる。\nこれほどの人員を投入して回収する物とは…。\nヘンリーの隠しているものとは一体…？

研究員の救出を試みたが、時すでに遅し。\n研究員の多くはすでにソウルジャンクと化していた。\nそして、暗闇からは別のソウルジャンクも現れた。\n「ジャンクナイト」\nまるでソウルワーカーをベースにしたような個体だ。\n「ジャンクナイト」は凄まじい力を見せつけると、\n再び闇の中へ消えてしまった。

アーロンの命令で、ビクターにサンプルを渡した。\nキャサリンとブロックが何やら言い争っている間に、\nサンプルについての解析結果が出た。\nバキュームべインとともにサンプルから\n抽出されたのは「アンチソウル」だった。\nヒックス博士によってソウルワーカーに対抗すべく\n作られた物質…それが、ネッドカンパニーによって\n再び作り出されているというのだ。\nヘンリーは地下水路の状況を知っていながら、\n図々しくも傲慢な態度をとり続けていた。\nブロックがアンチソウルについて尋ねても、\n彼は口をつぐんだままだった。\n仕方なく戻って来ると、ラルフが近寄ってきた。

引き裂かれた理想
ジェレミーは私を罵倒した。\n彼にとってエミリートと私は英雄だった。\nしかし、一人は何もできず、\nもう一人はあまりにも容易く命を落とした。\n恐ろしい現実を目の当たりにしたジェレミーは、\n誰かに恨みをぶつけるほか無かったのだろう。\nそんな時にセニアから呼び出しがあった。\nネッドカンパニーの秘密基地を探し出したという\n彼女の言葉に目の覚める思いがした。

無力化
ネッドカンパニーの秘密基地の内部を\nスキャンするために様々な方法を試したが、\nジャミングの発生によりスキャンが全くできない。\nそこで、妨害電波を発生させる機械を無力化する\nEMP爆弾を内部に設置することにした。\n作戦は成功し、内部施設をスキャンできた。\nリベンジの時は近い…。

Time for Caution
基地内部をスキャンした結果、\n幾つかの生命反応をキャッチした。\nその内二つはヘンリーとラウファー。\n残りの生命反応はすでに秘密基地を脱出している。\n…悠長に待つつもりはない。\n今すぐ、彼らの命をもって償わせなければ…！

ラウファーはエミリートの死に\n大きなショックと罪悪感を抱いていた。\nそんな彼を後に、ヘンリーを探して内部を駆け回る。\nそして、ついに見つけた。\n彼は人工的に作られたソウルワーカー、\nニアソウルワーカーのラバンを送り出す。

冷たい空気
ケインバレルと共にニアソウルワーカーの反応を追い到着した場所は、かつてネッドカンパニーの軍事要塞として使われていた「ルインフォートレス」だった。鋼鉄で作られた要塞は、周囲の冷たい空気と合わさり、一層物静かな様相をかもし出していた。今は誰一人おらず、機能も停止しているという事実が、その印象を強めた。\nスタリーフォレスト連合のメンバーはすでに到着していた。作戦指揮官である「マーティン」、通信担当の「アマンダ」、エナジー関連の「サラ」と簡単な挨拶をかわし、現状の説明を受けた。急造チームゆえ、施設に対する把握もままならず、全員初対面なのでチームワークも期待できそうにない。\n話を聞いたケインバレルは、思いやられたようにため息をつく。

急造チームではあるが、個々人の能力は優れており、すぐに現状と施設把握のために動き出した。一番大きな問題は電力の制御権。ルインフォートレスの電力は生きているが、制御権がロックされている状態だった。\nその制御権を握るAIがいるはずだと推測するアマンダ。これほどの施設を制御するためには必然的にAI級の制御システムが必要になるという判断だった。\n制御権を確保できなければ、ニアソウルワーカーの捜索はおろかできることがない。そこで、まずは施設の制御権を握っているであろうAIの存在を確認するために施設内部に進入する。\n内部調査の結果、AIの存在とニアソウルワーカーが乗っていたシャトル内部はすでにもぬけの殻だったことが確認された。ならば、次にやることはそのAI…「ルーシー」の確保。ルーシーが我々を敵と認識するかもという不安を胸に抱きながら前へと進む。

作られた敵意
自我を持っているかのように見えるほどのAIが、たった一つのヘッドウェアによって運用されているとは考えにくいというサラ。メインAIコアをサポートする多数のサブAIコアがあるはずだという。\nルーシーをハッキングするほどの技術はなく、ルーシーが我々に敵対的であるため、サブAIコアを物理的に破壊して演算能力を低下させ、その後ハッキングを通してルーシーを確保するという作戦を立てた。\nむざむざ敵に討たれに行くような危険を伴う作戦だったが、ケインバレルは緊急連絡を受けグレイスシティに戻ってしまった。\n状況は良くない中、なんとか内部へ進入してサブAIコア破壊し、駐屯地から実行されるハッキングを待つ。だが、駐屯地の誰もハッキング技術を持たないという事実が判明し、虚しさを胸に戻ろうとしたその時、幼い少年が目の前に現れた。

残された子ども
少年はルインフォートレスで起こったある事件によって取り残された難民だった。名前は「アベル」。不安に怯えている姿が痛ましく、急いで駐屯地へ連れて帰った。\n駐屯地でアベルを疑うマーティンと、その彼を批難するアマンダが言い争ったが、結局アマンダがアベルに何があったのか事情を聞くことになった。

Lucy's Punishment!
アベルはルインフォートレス開発に携わった研究員の息子で、家族全員がルインフォートレスで生活していたが、突然の事故に見舞われたようだった。ここで人をまったく見かけないことと深く関係しているのだろう。アベルは秘密の部屋で非常食を食べながら生きながらえ、人の気配を感じて助けを求めたのだという。\n研究員の息子だというアベルは、ルインフォートレスの電力を確保する方法を教えてくれた。ルーシーは、人の代わりに動くAIにすぎない。削除さえしてしまえば、施設の制御権は自然とこちらの手に渡るという。\n急いでルーシーをフォーマットして施設の制御権を手にしたものの、別の問題が発生した。

一つのための三つ
施設の制御権は手に入れたが、肝心の施設を稼働するための電力が不足している状況だった。現状ではドアの開閉程度しかできないという。\nそもそも要塞として存在する以上、外部電力に頼るはずはないと主張するサラ。アベルがサラの言葉に同意する。\nルインフォートレスはバスターコアと呼ばれる自律動力源によって運用されているが、バスターコアは3つのスレイブコアから動力を得て電力に転換する役割をもっており、スレイブコアが全て稼働すれば、ルインフォートレスの電力を自由に使用できるようになるという。\nアベルの言葉通りにスレイブコアの稼働に成功し、ルインフォートレスに電力が正常供給された。

だが、また別の問題が発生した。スレイブコアを「非認識者」が起動したと認識され、残りの二つのスレイブコアが稼動したスレイブコアを「敵」として認識、そこから発生する動力を遮断しているという。\n結局、ルーシーの時と同じように物理的に二つのスレイブコアを破壊することを決定するサラ。二つの動力が破壊されれば電力が半分以上減少するが、今の状況では「味方」がスレイブコアを起動したと認識させる方法はない。ニアソウルワーカーがここで何をしようとしているのかわからない以上、一刻も早く捜索を開始しなければならない。\nスレイブコアを破壊して帰る途中、駐屯地から妙なざわめきを感じた。アベルが突然姿を消したのだという。

少年の真意
アベルの反応はバスターコア深層部で確認された。どうやってそこへ行ったのか、いつ消えたのか謎は多いが、今はアベルの身柄を確保することが優先だ。 \n捜索を進行中、クロエの態度に違和感を覚えた。まるで別人のように思えたので追及すると、突然アベルの姿がオペレーターディスプレイに現れた。状況がまったく掴めずにいると、突然アベルがバスターコアから姿を現した。\nそして、自らをニアソウルワーカーだと言い放った。

アベルは我々のおかげで仕事が捗ったと、感謝とは言いがたい感謝を口にし、そのまま姿を消した。アベルを追跡してバスターコア深層部に到着すると、アベルはバスターコアのエナジーを吸収し始めた。アベルを止めようとした時、目の前に別のニアソウルワーカー「ノア」が立ちふさがった。\n戦闘は長引き、アベルはバスターコアのエナジーを全て吸収してノアと共に逃走した。\n駐屯地に戻って来ると、煮え切らない皆の姿が目に入ってきた。

光を追う
アベルがバスターコアのエナジーの大部分を吸収してしまったため、施設の制御計画に狂いが生じた。仕方がないので、最小限の施設制御でニアソウルワーカー捜索作戦を本格的に始めることを決定。現状でできるアベル追跡を進めることとなった。\n固有の波動を持つバスターコアのエナジーをアベルが吸収したので、その波動を追跡した結果、地下で反応を確認。まるで我々を誘導するかのような反応だった。\n地下に降りると、シャトル移動路があった。シャトルで移動する程広くは見えない場所ではあるが…。捜索を進行したが、シャトル移動路の奥では巨大な扉が道を遮っていた。重い足取りで一度駐屯地へと戻る。

突然の出会い
現状、道を塞いでいた門を開く方法はないので、別ルートのシャトル移動路に進入した。退屈な探索任務が続いていたが、突然、ネッドカンパニーの兵力とシャトル移動路で遭遇した。\n小さな戦闘が発生し、彼らのリーダーだと思われる男は逃走したが、身体の弱そうに見える老人一人は、その場に黙って立っていた。たじろいだ様子も、焦った様子もなかった。まるで、こういう状況を待っていたかのように、とても穏やかな姿だった。

一緒に駐屯地へ戻ってきた老人の名は「ヒックス」。ネッドカンパニー所属の博士であり、生命工学関連ではクラウドリームで一番の権威だという。\n何か目的があってスタリーフォレスト連合に接近したことは明らかだが、その目的が何なのかは一切口にしなかった。結局、ヒックスから情報を得ることを諦め、再びシャトル移動路に進入することになった。\nそして、シャトル移動路の奥…巨大な鉄の扉がある場所で、また別のニアソウルワーカー「エノック」と遭遇する。\nエノックもノアと同様に全力を出しているようには見えなかった。何か奥の手があるような妙な言葉を残して退却するエノック。\n戦闘を終え、扉の向こうのエナジー反応を調査した結果、アベルが吸収したバスターコアのエナジーが確認された。

巨大な鉄の扉の奥にあったのは武器庫だった。しかも条約によって生産が禁止された対人兵器が眠っていた。ネッドカンパニーが最初からスタリーフォレスト連合と戦争をするための準備を進めていたという動かぬ証拠だった。\nそして、アマンダから新たな情報が入る。エナジー反応の動きが小さくなってきたのだという。\nつまり、アベルがバスターコアのエナジーを持ったまま特定位置で何かをしていることは明白だった。

下に、より深く
ヒックスはアベルがバスターコアの力を吸収したのはデウス・エクス・マキナを起動するためで、デウス・エクス・マキナで戦いを挑んできたのはソウルワーカーだけが持つソウルエナジーが必要だったからだと説明した。\nソウルワーカー用兵器として作られたデウス・エクス・マキナは、ソウルワーカーの固有エナジーをコアに吸収する機能を持っており、戦闘を通してコアにはソウルワーカーの固有エナジーが集まったのだという。\nそのエナジーを利用してディープコアを起動することがアベルの目的だった。ディープコアの起動は、ソウルワーカーだけが可能であり、それゆえにネッドカンパニーの高位幹部は全員ソウルワーカーで構成されているのだという。\nアベルは作られたソウルワーカーだった。力の大きさは真似できたが、固有エナジー自体は性質が違うので、本物のソウルワーカーの力が必要だったらしい。\n本当の目的はまだ不明だが、アベルを止めるべきだということは確かなようだ。

振動の原因は、超巨大掘削機械「ディグモンスター」の起動によるものだというヒックス。たった7機のディグモンスターでルインフォートレスの地形を一ヶ月で構築したという、その名の通り「地を掘る怪物」である。アベルはこれを利用して地下深くに眠るプロトタイプニアソウルワーカー「シオン」を復活させようとしていた。\nシオンは、ルインフォートレスの全ての者を虐殺し、ルインフォートレスの地下に封印された最強最悪のニアソウルワーカーで、復活すればネッドカンパニーであろうがスタリーフォレスト連合であろうが終わりだとこぼすヒックス。\n信じられない話だが、ネッドカンパニーがこのようなハイテクノロジーの集約体ともいえる場所を捨てて行ったという事実がそれを裏付けている。\nシオンの復活を阻止するために、ディグモンスターを止めよう。\nたとえそれがアベルを悲しませることだとしても…。

The World's Axis
同じソウルワーカーなら何か知っているかもしれないという微かな希望を胸にケインバレルを訪ねた。だが、彼も金の鎧を纏い槍を持つ女性に心当たりはなかった。しかし、金色だということから「イオ」に話を聞いてみるのはどうかと提案してきた。\nイオの回答は想定外のものだった。あの女性の名はロスカー。限りなく神に近い存在であり、ソウルワーカーたちの原点。\n世界の軸を正すための歯車として選択され、成長するのを待たれていたらしい。しかし、予想外の出来事により危機に陥ったため、絶対に世界に介入しないという約束を破って助けてくれたのだ。その約束が破られたことで、世界の各地に異常空白が発生していた。\nイオはいつか来る災厄に備え、力をつけるようにと言う。そして、その為の場所として異常空白への進入を提案してきた。

Anomaly
激しい戦いの末に残ったのは、行き場のない虚しさだけ。シオンを含めたニアソウルワーカーたちは忽然と姿を消し、後には何も残らなかった。\n そして、シオンと黄金の鎧をまとった女性「ロスカー」の戦いにより発生した強大なエナジーは異常空白の活動を活発にし、世界は混乱に包まれ始めた。ニアソウルワーカーの確保に失敗し目的を失ったソウルワーカー、そしてルインフォートレスの調査隊は自由に出入りが可能であるという特異事項を持った巨大な異常空白の調査へと送り込まれた。

ソウルワーカーは巨大な異常空白の中で見たものは、崩れゆく建物や大地の隙間に入り込む雨水と、不気味な紫色の空だった。地面ごと空白に飲み込まれたかのようなその都市には何も残されておらず、死の大地と呼ぶのにふさわしい有様だ。\n 一足先に駐屯しているスタリーフォレスト連合の駐屯軍から紹介されたのは、5年前に死んだといわれている伝説のソウルワーカー、テネブリス……を名乗る男性だった。

光を失った火種
異常空白の中で最初に敵対したのはグレイスシティで戦ったヴェシ、ラピッドフレイムの残党だった。恐らくは、他の人々と同様に空白に吸い込まれて来たのだろう。皆が戦いに備える中、テネブリスだけは彼らの攻撃的な様子に違和感を覚えていた。

幻聴
生存者の存在を確認するために設置した「スピリットパスファインダー」はソウルエナジーを感知できず、使い物にならない。通信担当のアマンダは通信中に妙な声が聞こえたと言う。やはり、空白内部の調査は順調に行わせてもらえないようだ。\n ラピッドフレイムの残党と武器を交えるソウルワーカーの前に立ちはだかったのは、かつて多くの人を殺めたコードネーム「テンペスト」。奴等は大気中のエナジーを吸いこむことができるその機械を利用して何かを企んでいたようだが、その企みはソウルワーカーによって打ち砕かれた。

フォーチュン部隊の到着
ラピッドフレイムを退けたことで、ようやく異常空白の駐屯地も落ち着くことができた。そのため、既にロコタウンで準備を完了していた医務部隊フォーチュンを異常空白内部へを新入させることも可能となり、部隊の一員としてやってきたミリアムとも話すことができた。しかし、彼女の様子は普段と違って見える。どうやら「テネブリス」について何かを隠しているようだ。

無惨な残り香
駐屯地からヴェシが退いたことで、それまでは容易に行えなかった調査チームの調査が進行可能となり、その結果正体不明の空間が確認された。\n そこでソウルワーカーが目にしたのはロコタウンにそっくりな街並みと、かつての敵の幻影だった。

Desire's Territory
異常空白で見たものをテネブリスに伝えたところ、彼はその全ての現象について空白の内部では驚くほどの事でもないと言い切った。どうやら此処は「デザイアエナジーの領土」であるらしい。この空間を満たす圧倒的なデザイアエナジーは、その欲望を成す力をもって常識では理解の及ばない現象を引き起こす。\n マーティンは「デザイアエナジーと反発し、無力化される筈のソウルエナジーを今でも使用できる」ことに疑問を抱いたようだが、テネブリスはその疑問をはぐらかすように口を挟んだ。\n そんななか、ミリアムはテネブリスの様子をしきりに気にかけているようだったが、今の様子では彼女が彼に話しかけるのに相当な時間が必要だろう。

それは「影」であり、「過去の姿」であるとテネブリスは言った。そして、取り返しのつかない何かがおきてしまう前に此処を立ち去れとも。\n 無視していれば何とかなると思っていただけに衝撃だった。ひとりで考えるだけではどうしようもなく、ミリアムに相談することにした。

緊急召集
調査を重ねるほど疑惑は深まるばかり、困惑していたソウルワーカーの元にトールから緊急連絡が届く。\n連絡の内容は他でもない空白内で起こった事件についてだった。\nグラスカバーキャンプで異能力者たちが消える事件が発生したのだ。\nロイについての調査はまだ終わってないが、これ以上の被害を増やすわけにはいかない。\nソウルワーカーは合流したケインバレルと共にグラスカバーキャンプへと向かうのだった。

Dipluce Port City
アーロンはベネリスが口にしたヘンリーという名に、興味を示す他なかった。\nベネリスの説明によるとヘンリーはディプルスの港湾都市に居て、そこでソウルジャンククイーンを探して世界を滅ぼす事を企んでいるそうだった。\nブロックは危ないので行かないで欲しかったが、アーロンはその言葉を無視し、私もヘンリーの手がかりを探す為、半分は自分の意志でディプルスに向かう事になった。

天支配作戦
たどり着いたディプルスの港湾都市はすでにソウルジャンクに占領され、廃墟ようになっていた。\nシンクホールと海を挟んだ場所にやっとの思いで定着した私たちは、急いで駐屯地を構築する必要があった。そのためにはブロックの意見に基づいて、この地で最も高い場所、つまり建物の屋上を攻略する必要があった。

狂気で暴れる者
初の防衛線構築終えて帰還すると、アーロンは一人の兵士に怒っていた。\n兵士はもう少しだけ安全な任務を欲していたが、一人一人の事情や要望を受け入れ始めると、「このような地獄に残るような者は誰一人居ないだろう」と言った。\nここでは、人を兵士として、兵士を道具として扱うところだった。

最悪の暗君
アーロンはキャサリンの写真が入っているペンダントを持っていた。見てみたいと言ってみたが、帰って来た冷たい態度だけで、アーロンが変わったと確認することができた。\nしかも、アーロンが兵士を銃殺したという話を聞いて、ここで戦う理由について悩んだがブロックがその銃殺された兵士を生かしたという事を聞いて、人々を助けるといった目的を再び胸に刻んで戦う意味を得る事ができた。

意味の無い事
次の任務は建物の間を移動している、巨大ソウルジャンクの退治だった。ここが危険にさらされたり攻撃される恐れはなかったが、アーロンは戦闘データ収集の目的で無理やり私を戦場に追いやった。\nこんな理由で戦うのは何も意味ない事ではないかと再び悩んだが、もはやそんなの悩む余裕もなさそうだった。

久々の余裕
駐屯地構築が完了し、本格的にシンクホールの下を調査する必要があった。しかし、深さの分からない場所を飛び降りるのは無理だった。シンクホールを降下することが可能な装備を手配する為、ルインフォートレスに居るトールのもとへ向かった。

ルインフォートレスで会ったトールはニアソウルワーカーを見つけたという情報を持っていたが、マーティンはそれを全面的に否定した。\nルインフォートレスでは何の事が起こっているのか？しかし、他の急がなければならない事があったため、そのままディプルスに復帰した。

降下機を運ぶために出発した艦隊は、ソウルジャンクが密集している海域を通らなければならなかった。\n何か大きな問題が起こる前に私も艦隊の方に向かって船を守り始めた。

不信の連鎖
ブロックは以前、銃殺から救い出した兵士、グルーウェルという男と話していた。\nグルーウェルはアーロンに向かった嫌悪と憎悪でいっぱいになったが、ブロックが抑えていたので、静かに我慢していた。\nこのような状況でもビクターは人々の死体を利用するとか、変な話をしながら自分の事を理解して欲しいと言っていたが…私は彼を理解する事は難しかった。

アーロンの状態はより悪化していた。自分の個人時間が邪魔されるという理由でブロックに大声を上げたり、周辺の人々に良くない印象を与えていた。\n果してこの状態で駐屯地は維持できるのだろうか、という不安しか残らなかった。

降下機設置作業が始まってから駐屯地の雰囲気も少しは変わってきたが、相変らずアーロンは復讐心に燃え上がっていた。降下機設置作業にまるで道具のように人々を無理して投入させる姿は良くない印象を与えていった。

無理な駐屯地構築作業と休む間も無く続く設置作業で兵士たちの不満と疲れが溢れ出した時、遂に船を盗んで脱走する事件が起ってしまった。\nアーロンとベネリスは降下機設置作業を無視して、脱走した兵士を追う時間が無いので黙認する事を決定したが…、アーロンのペンダントが消えた事で状況は変わってきた。

特殊部隊がテネブリスと交戦したらしい。\nしかし、やはり本物ではなく幻想に過ぎなかったようだ。

雪山の調査に着手
グレイスの状況を確認した。\nやはり西部の奴らは、我々東部に反感を持っている。\nトールは作戦官セニアの助言を聞き入れ、最初から消極的であった。
